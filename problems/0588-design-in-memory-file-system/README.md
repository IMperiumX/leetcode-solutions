# 588. Design In-Memory File System, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

Design a data structure that simulates an in-memory file system.

Implement the `FileSystem` class:

*   `FileSystem()` Initializes the object of the system.
*   `List<String> ls(String path)`
    *   If `path` is a file path, returns a list that only contains this file's name.
    *   If `path` is a directory path, returns the list of file and directory names *in this directory*.
    * The answer should in **lexicographic order**.
*   `void mkdir(String path)` Makes a new directory according to the given `path`. The given directory path does not exist. If the middle directories in the path do not exist, you should create them as well.
*   `void addContentToFile(String filePath, String content)`
    *   If `filePath` does not exist, creates that file containing given `content`.
    *   If `filePath` already exists, appends the given `content` to original content.
*   `String readContentFromFile(String filePath)` Returns the content in the file at `filePath`.

Example 1:
Input
["FileSystem","ls","mkdir","addContentToFile","ls","readContentFromFile"]
[[],["/"],["/a/b/c"],["/a/b/c/d","hello"],["/"],["/a/b/c/d"]]
Output
[null,[],null,null,["a"],"hello"]

Explanation:
- FileSystem fileSystem = new FileSystem();
- fileSystem.ls("/");                         // return []
- fileSystem.mkdir("/a/b/c");
- fileSystem.addContentToFile("/a/b/c/d", "hello");
- fileSystem.ls("/");                         // return ["a"]
- fileSystem.readContentFromFile("/a/b/c/d"); // return "hello"

Constraints:

1 <= path.length, filePath.length <= 100
path and filePath are absolute paths which begin with '/' and do not end with '/' except that the path is just "/".
You can assume that all directory names and file names only contain lowercase letters, and the same names will not exist in the same directory.
You can assume that all operations will be passed valid parameters, and users will not attempt to retrieve file content or list a directory or file that does not exist.
1 <= content.length <= 50
At most 300 calls will be made to ls, mkdir, addContentToFile, and readContentFromFile.

## Approach(es)

### Nested Dictionaries and FileNode Class

Algorithm:

1.  **`FileNode` Class:**
    *   `is_dir`: Boolean flag to indicate whether it's a directory or a file.
    *   `children`: A dictionary to store child nodes (files and subdirectories).  Only used if `is_dir` is True. Key is the name (string), and value is the `FileNode` object.
    *   `content`: A string to store the file content. Only used if `is_dir` is False.
    *   `name`: A string to store the name of the file/directory.

2.  **`FileSystem` Class:**
    *   `root`: A `FileNode` representing the root directory.
    *   `_traverse(self, path, create_dirs=False)`:  A helper function to traverse the file system path.
        *   Splits the `path` by `/` to get individual components.
        *   Starts at the `root`.
        *   Iterates through the path components:
            *   If a component doesn't exist in the current node's `children`:
                *   If `create_dirs` is `True`, create a new `FileNode` (directory) for that component.
                *   If `create_dirs` is `False`, return `None` (path doesn't exist).
            *   Move to the child node.
        *   Returns the final `FileNode` reached.
    *   `ls(self, path)`:
        *   Traverse to the given `path` using `_traverse`.
        *   If the final node is a file, return a list containing the file's name.
        *   If the final node is a directory, return a sorted list of its children's names.
    *   `mkdir(self, path)`:
        *   Traverse to the given `path` using `_traverse` with `create_dirs=True`.  This creates any necessary intermediate directories.
    *   `addContentToFile(self, filePath, content)`:
        *   Traverse to the given `filePath` using `_traverse` with `create_dirs=True`.
        *   Append the `content` to the `content` string of the final node. Sets the node to be a file.
    *   `readContentFromFile(self, filePath)`:
        *   Traverse to the given `filePath` using `_traverse`.
        *   Return the `content` string of the final node.

Data Structures:

*   Nested Dictionaries (within the `FileNode` class)
*   String (for file content and paths)

Time Complexity:

*   `ls`: O(m + n log n), where m is the length of the path and n is the number of entries in the final directory.  Traversal is O(m), and sorting is O(n log n).
*   `mkdir`: O(m), where m is the length of the path.
*   `addContentToFile`: O(m + k), where m is the length of the path and k is length of the content.
*   `readContentFromFile`: O(m), where m is the length of the path.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the total number of files and directories (and the sum of their content lengths).  We store all file/directory information and content in the `FileNode` objects.

Trade-offs:
* This design efficiently handles file/directory operations by utilizing nested dictionaries.

## Code

```python
class FileSystem:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = self.FileNode(True, "")  # Root directory

    def ls(self, path: str) -> list[str]:
        node = self._traverse(path)
        if not node.is_dir:  # If it's a file, return the file name
            return [node.name]
        return sorted(node.children)  # Return sorted list of children (files/dirs)

    def mkdir(self, path: str) -> None:
        self._traverse(path, create_dirs=True)

    def addContentToFile(self, filePath: str, content: str) -> None:
        node = self._traverse(filePath, create_dirs=True)
        node.is_dir = False  # Ensure it's treated as a file
        node.content += content

    def readContentFromFile(self, filePath: str) -> str:
        node = self._traverse(filePath)
        return node.content

    def _traverse(self, path: str, create_dirs: bool = False):
        """Helper function to traverse the file system."""
        curr = self.root
        if path == "/":
            return curr

        components = path.split("/")[1:]  # Split path into components
        for i, component in enumerate(components):
            is_last = i == len(components) -1
            if component not in curr.children:
                if create_dirs:
                    curr.children[component] = self.FileNode(not is_last, component)
                else:
                    return None  # Path doesn't exist
            curr = curr.children[component]
        return curr

    class FileNode:
        def __init__(self, is_dir: bool, name:str):
            self.is_dir = is_dir
            self.children = {}  # For directories: {name: FileNode}
            self.content = ""    # For files: content of the file
            self.name = name
```

## Notes

* This problem is a classic example of a design problem that requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms.
* Using a nested dictionary structure (within the `FileNode` class) allows for efficient traversal and manipulation of the file system hierarchy.
* The `_traverse` helper function is crucial for simplifying the implementation of other methods.
* The solution is well-structured and uses object-oriented principles effectively.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic Extraction
*Analysis:* Relevant topics are "Design", "Hash Table", "String", and "Tree" (because the file system structure is hierarchical, like a tree).

* `Design.md`: (already exists, we reuse it.)
* `Hash Table.md`: (already exists, we reuse it.)
* `String.md`: (already exists, we reuse it.)
* `Tree.md`: (already exists, we reuse it.)
