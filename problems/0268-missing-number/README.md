# 268. Missing Number, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the *only* number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

## Approach(es)

### Gauss' Formula Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to `n` using Gauss' Formula: `expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`.
2.  Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the `nums` array: `actual_sum = sum(nums)`.
3.  The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum: `return expected_sum - actual_sum`.

Data Structures:

*   None

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - We use only constant extra space.

Trade-offs:

* Very efficient approach, in terms of time and memory.

### XOR Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `missing` with `n` (the length of the array).
2.  Iterate through the `nums` array, using both the index `i` and the value `num`:
    *   XOR `missing` with `i` and `num`:  `missing ^= i ^ num`
3.  Return `missing`.

Explanation:

The XOR approach leverages the properties of XOR (as explained in the "Single Number" problem).  We XOR all numbers from 0 to `n` (including `n` itself) and all numbers in the `nums` array.  The duplicate numbers will cancel out, leaving us with the missing number.

Data Structures:

* None

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - We use only constant extra space.

Trade-offs:
* Very efficient approach, in terms of time and memory.

### Sorting Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Sort the `nums` array.
2.  Iterate through the sorted array:
    *   If the current number `nums[i]` is not equal to its index `i`, then `i` is the missing number. Return `i`.
3.  If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it means all numbers from 0 to `n-1` are present, so `n` is the missing number. Return `n`.

Data Structures:

*   None (sorting is typically done in place)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n) - Dominated by the sorting step.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) (or O(n) if the sorting algorithm used requires extra space, and does not work in-place) - Python's `list.sort()` generally sorts in place, using Timsort, but for consistency we will assume best/average cases.

Trade-offs:

* This approach is less efficient than the Gauss' Formula and XOR approaches due to the sorting step.

[XOR Approach](./solution_xor.py)
[Sorting Approach](./solution_sorting.py)

## Notes

*   Gauss' Formula and the XOR approach are the most efficient solutions, with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
*   The sorting approach is less efficient but provides a different perspective on the problem.
* This problem illustrates the importance of choosing the right algorithm based on efficiency requirements.
*   It's a good practice to consider mathematical properties (like Gauss' Formula) and bitwise operations (like XOR) when solving problems involving numbers.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic Extraction.
*Analysis:* Relevant topics are "Arrays", "Bit Manipulation", "Math", and "Sorting".

*   `Arrays.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Bit Manipulation.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Sorting.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   Create `Math.md`:

The "Math" topic in algorithms and data structures encompasses problems and solutions that involve mathematical concepts, formulas, and reasoning.  These problems often require applying mathematical knowledge to develop efficient algorithms.

## Common Mathematical Concepts in Algorithms

*   **Number Theory:**  Concepts like prime numbers, divisibility, greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), modular arithmetic.
*   **Combinatorics:**  Counting techniques, permutations, combinations, factorials, binomial coefficients.
*   **Probability and Statistics:**  Calculating probabilities, expected values, distributions.
*   **Geometry:**  Problems involving shapes, areas, volumes, distances, points, lines, etc.
*   **Linear Algebra:**  Matrices, vectors, linear transformations (less common in basic algorithm problems, more common in advanced topics like machine learning).
*   **Calculus:**  Derivatives, integrals (rarely used directly in typical algorithm problems, but understanding calculus can sometimes help with optimization).
*   **Series and Sequences:** Arithmetic series, geometric series, Fibonacci sequence, etc.
* **Gauss Formula**

## Techniques for Solving Math-Related Algorithm Problems

*   **Formula Application:** Directly applying known mathematical formulas (e.g., Gauss' Formula for the sum of an arithmetic series).
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying patterns in numbers or sequences to derive a formula or algorithm.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:**  Using modulo operations to handle large numbers or prevent overflow.
*   **Prime Factorization:**  Breaking down numbers into their prime factors.
* **Recursion/Dynamic Programming**
