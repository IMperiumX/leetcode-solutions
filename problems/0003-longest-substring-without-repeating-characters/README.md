# Hash Tables

Hash tables (also known as hash maps, dictionaries, or associative arrays) are a fundamental data structure that provides efficient key-value storage and retrieval. They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for average O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Key Concepts

*   **Key:** A unique identifier used to access a value.
*   **Value:** The data associated with a key.
*   **Hash Function:** A function that takes a key as input and returns an integer, called a hash code.  The hash code is used as an index into the underlying array.
*   **Collision:** When two different keys produce the same hash code.  Collision handling is a crucial aspect of hash table design.
*   **Load Factor:** The ratio of the number of elements stored in the hash table to the size of the underlying array.  A high load factor can lead to increased collisions and degraded performance.

## Collision Handling Techniques

*   **Separate Chaining:** Each index in the array stores a linked list (or another data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
*   **Open Addressing:** If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for an empty slot in the array.  Common probing techniques include:
    *   **Linear Probing:**  Check consecutive slots until an empty slot is found.
    *   **Quadratic Probing:** Check slots with increasing quadratic offsets.
    *   **Double Hashing:**  Use a secondary hash function to determine the probing interval.

## Common Hash Table Operations

*   **put(key, value):** Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.
*   **get(key):** Retrieves the value associated with a key.  Returns `None` (or a similar value) if the key is not found.
*   **remove(key):** Deletes the key-value pair associated with a key.
*   **containsKey(key):** Returns `True` if the hash table contains the key, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of key-value pairs in the hash table.
*   **isEmpty():** Checks whether hash table is empty.

## Advantages of Hash Tables

*   **Fast Average-Case Performance:**  O(1) for insertion, deletion, and lookup, on average.
*   **Efficient Key-Based Access:**  Ideal for scenarios where you need to quickly retrieve data based on a unique key.

## Disadvantages of Hash Tables

*   **Worst-Case Performance:**  O(n) for all operations in the worst case (when all keys hash to the same index).
*   **Unordered Data:**  Hash tables do not maintain the order of elements.
*   **Hash Function Dependence:** The performance of a hash table heavily relies on the quality of the hash function.  A poor hash function can lead to frequent collisions and poor performance.

# Sliding Window

The Sliding Window technique is a common and efficient approach for solving problems that involve finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions. It's particularly useful when dealing with arrays or strings and looking for contiguous sequences.

## Key Concepts

*   **Window:** A contiguous portion (subarray or substring) of the input data.
*   **Sliding:** The window "slides" across the input data, typically one element at a time.
*   **Dynamic Window Size:** The size of the window can be fixed or variable, depending on the problem requirements.
*   **Constraints/Conditions:**  The problem usually specifies conditions that the window must satisfy (e.g., containing unique characters, summing to a target value, etc.).

## How Sliding Window Works

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, typically `left` and `right`, which define the boundaries of the window.  Often, both pointers start at the beginning of the input data.
2.  **Expansion:**  Move the `right` pointer to expand the window, adding elements to the window until the window satisfies the problem's constraints.
3.  **Contraction (if necessary):** If the window violates the constraints, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the constraints are met again.
4.  **Update Result:**  As the window slides, update the desired result (e.g., maximum length, minimum sum, etc.) based on the current window.
5.  **Termination:**  Continue sliding the window until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the input data.

## Common Variations

*   **Fixed-Size Window:** The size of the window is constant throughout the process.
*   **Variable-Size Window:** The size of the window changes dynamically as the window slides.
*   **Two Pointers:** The core of the sliding window technique involves using two pointers to manage the window boundaries.

## Advantages of Sliding Window

*   **Efficiency:** Can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) or O(n^3) (brute-force approaches) to O(n).
*   **Space Efficiency:** Often requires only constant extra space (O(1)), especially for fixed-size windows.

## When to Consider Sliding Window

*   The problem involves finding subarrays or substrings.
*   The problem specifies constraints or conditions on contiguous sequences.
*   The problem asks for the "longest," "shortest," "maximum," or "minimum" of something related to subarrays/substrings.

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common and efficient approach for solving problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (usually indices) to traverse the data structure, often from opposite ends or moving at different speeds. This technique can significantly reduce time complexity compared to nested loops or brute-force approaches.

## Common Patterns

*   **Opposite Ends:** Two pointers start at the beginning and end of the data structure and move towards each other.  This is useful for problems like palindrome checking, finding pairs that sum to a target, or reversing an array in place.
*   **Same Direction (Fast and Slow):** Two pointers start at the same position but move at different speeds. This is often used in linked list problems to detect cycles, find the middle element, or find the nth element from the end.
*   **Sliding Window:** Two pointers define a "window" within the data structure, and the window slides across the data. This is helpful for problems involving subarrays or substrings, such as finding the longest substring with unique characters or finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a given size.
*    **Multiple Arrays/Strings:** Two pointers traverse separate arrays/strings.

## Advantages of Two Pointers

*   **Efficiency:** Can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) or from O(n log n) to O(n).
*   **Space Efficiency:** Often requires only constant extra space (O(1)).
*   **Readability:** Can make code more concise and easier to understand compared to nested loops.

## When to Consider Two Pointers

*   The problem involves arrays, strings, or linked lists.
*   The problem requires finding a pair, a subsequence, or a specific condition that involves comparing elements at different positions.
*   The data structure is sorted (but not always required).
*   In-place modification is desired (for problems like reversing or removing elements).

# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring
without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Approach(es)

### Sliding Window Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize a set (`char_set`) to store the characters in the current window.
2.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at 0. These define the window boundaries.
3.  Initialize `max_length` to 0, to store the maximum length found so far.
4.  Iterate with the `right` pointer through the string:
    *   **Check for Duplicates:** While the character at `s[right]` is already in `char_set`:
        *   Remove the character at `s[left]` from `char_set`.
        *   Increment `left` to shrink the window from the left.
    *   **Add Current Character:** Add the character at `s[right]` to `char_set`.
    *   **Update Max Length:** Update `max_length` with the maximum of its current value and the current window size (`right - left + 1`).
5.  Return `max_length`.

Data Structures:

*   A set (`char_set`) to efficiently check for the presence of characters in the current window (O(1) lookup).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.  Both `left` and `right` pointers traverse the string at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(k), where k is the size of the character set (the number of unique characters that can appear in the string). In the worst case, if all characters in the string are unique, k could be equal to n. However, given the constraints (English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces), k will be a relatively small constant.  Often this is considered O(1) or O(min(n, m)) where m is the size of the charset

Trade-offs:

*   The sliding window approach provides an efficient solution with linear time complexity.  It uses a set for fast character lookups, making it the preferred solution for this problem.

## Notes

This problem is a classic example of the sliding window technique.  The key is to maintain a window of non-repeating characters and efficiently expand and contract the window as you iterate through the string. The use of a set allows for quick checks for duplicate characters.
