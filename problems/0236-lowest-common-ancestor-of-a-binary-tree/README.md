# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10<sup>5</sup>].
-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the tree.

## Approach(es)

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Base Cases:**
    *   If `root` is `None`, return `None` (we've reached the end of a branch).
    *   If `root` is equal to `p` or `q`, return `root` (we've found one of the nodes).

2.  **Recursive Calls:**
    *   Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on the left subtree (`root.left`) with `p` and `q`. Store the result in `left`.
    *   Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on the right subtree (`root.right`) with `p` and `q`. Store the result in `right`.

3.  **Combine Results:**
    *   If both `left` and `right` are not `None`, it means `p` and `q` are in different subtrees of `root`.  Therefore, `root` is the LCA, so return `root`.
    *   If only `left` is not `None`, it means the LCA (or both `p` and `q`) is in the left subtree, so return `left`.
    *   If only `right` is not `None`, it means the LCA (or both `p` and `q`) is in the right subtree, so return `right`.
    *    If both are None return None

Data Structures:

*   Binary Tree (implicit in the recursion).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we might visit all nodes.

Space Complexity:

*   O(h) in the average case, and O(n) in the worst case (skewed tree), where h is the height of the tree.  This is due to the recursive call stack.

Trade-offs:

*   This recursive approach is generally clean and easy to understand.  The space complexity depends on the tree's height, but for balanced trees, it's quite efficient.

## Code

[Recursive Approach](./solution_recursive.py)

## Notes

*   The problem guarantees that `p` and `q` exist in the tree and are distinct. This simplifies the logic.
*   An iterative approach using a stack is possible, but the recursive solution is often preferred for its clarity.

# Tree

Trees are fundamental non-linear data structures in computer science that simulate a hierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes.

## Key Concepts

*   **Node:** The basic building block of a tree.  Each node contains data and may have links (pointers or references) to other nodes (its children).
*   **Root:** The topmost node in the tree. There is only one root node.
*   **Parent:** A node that has child nodes.
*   **Child:** A node that is connected to a parent node.
*   **Leaf:** A node with no children.
*   **Edge:** The connection between two nodes (parent and child).
*   **Depth of a node:** The number of edges from the root to the node.
*   **Height of a node:** The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. The height of the tree is the height of the root.
*   **Subtree:** A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.
*   **Ancestor:**  A node reachable by traversing parent pointers from a given node.
*   **Descendant:** A node reachable by traversing child pointers from a given node.

## Types of Trees

*   **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children (left and right).
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree where, for each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater.
*   **Balanced Binary Tree:** A binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1 (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees). Balanced trees ensure O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.
*   **Complete Binary Tree:**  All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
*   **Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree):** Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
*   **N-ary Tree (Generic Tree):**  Each node can have any number of children (not limited to two).
*   **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A special tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

## Tree Traversals

Tree traversals are methods for visiting each node in a tree exactly once. Common traversal methods include:

*   **Inorder (Left, Root, Right):**  Used primarily with binary search trees.  Visits nodes in sorted order.
*   **Preorder (Root, Left, Right):**  Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
*   **Postorder (Left, Right, Root):**  Useful for deleting a tree.
*   **Level Order (Breadth-First):**  Visits nodes level by level.  Uses a queue.

## Common Operations and Time Complexities (for Binary Trees)

| Operation        | Average Case   | Worst Case     | Notes                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Search (BST)     | O(log n)      | O(n)          | O(n) for skewed trees                        |
| Insert (BST)     | O(log n)      | O(n)          | O(n) for skewed trees                        |
| Delete (BST)     | O(log n)      | O(n)          | O(n) for skewed trees                        |
| Traversal        | O(n)          | O(n)          | Visits every node once                       |
| Find Min/Max (BST)| O(log n)      | O(n)          | O(1) if pointers to min/max are maintained    |

## Use Cases

Trees are used in a wide range of applications, including:

*   **File Systems:**  Directories and files are organized hierarchically.
*   **Databases:**  B-trees are used for indexing.
*   **Compilers:**  Syntax trees represent the structure of code.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Evaluating arithmetic expressions.
*   **Networking:**  Routing tables.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:**  Decision trees, game trees.
*   **HTML/XML Parsing:** Representing the document structure.

# Recursion

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. It's a way to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

## Key Concepts

*   **Base Case:** Every recursive function must have at least one base case. This is a condition that stops the recursion and returns a value without making any further recursive calls.  Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
*   **Recursive Step:** The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified version of the input, moving towards the base case.

## How Recursion Works

1.  **Function Call:** When a recursive function is called, a new stack frame is created on the call stack. This frame stores the function's local variables and the return address.
2.  **Recursive Calls:** The function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input.  Each call creates a new stack frame.
3.  **Base Case Reached:**  Eventually, the input reaches a point where the base case is triggered. The base case returns a value *without* making another recursive call.
4.  **Unwinding the Stack:**  As each recursive call returns, its corresponding stack frame is removed from the call stack.  The returned value is passed back to the calling function.  This process continues until the original function call returns.

## Example: Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  It can be defined recursively:

*   0! = 1 (Base Case)
*   n! = n * (n-1)! (Recursive Step)

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base Case
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive Step
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

## Advantages of Recursion

*   **Elegance and Readability:**  Recursive solutions can often be more concise and easier to understand than iterative solutions, especially for problems with a naturally recursive structure (like tree traversals).
*   **Problem Decomposition:**  Recursion makes it easier to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

## Disadvantages of Recursion

*   **Stack Overflow:**  Excessive recursion (too many nested calls) can lead to a stack overflow error if the call stack exceeds its limit.
*   **Performance Overhead:**  Function calls can be relatively expensive in terms of time and memory.  Recursive solutions can sometimes be less efficient than iterative solutions due to this overhead.
*   **Debugging:** Recursive code can sometimes be more difficult to debug than iterative code.

## Tail Recursion

Tail recursion is a special form of recursion where the recursive call is the *very last* operation performed in the function.  In other words, after the recursive call returns, there's nothing else to do in the current function except return the value.

Some compilers (but *not* standard CPython) can optimize tail-recursive functions by reusing the same stack frame for each recursive call.  This prevents stack overflow errors and makes tail-recursive functions as efficient as iterative loops.

Example (Tail-Recursive Factorial):

```python
def factorial_tail(n, accumulator=1):
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    # Recursive step (tail call)
    else:
        return factorial_tail(n - 1, n * accumulator)

print(factorial_tail(5)) # Output: 120
```
While Python doesn't perform tail-call optimization, this example demonstrates the concept.

## When to Use Recursion

Use recursion when:

*   The problem can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
*   The depth of recursion is unlikely to be excessive (or you're using a language with tail-call optimization).
*   Readability and clarity are more important than absolute performance.

Avoid recursion when:

*   The depth of recursion could be very large, risking stack overflow.
*   An iterative solution is significantly more efficient.
*   The problem doesn't have a clear recursive structure.
