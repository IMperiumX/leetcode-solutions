    Finds the single number in an array where every other element appears
    twice, using the XOR operation.

    Args:
        nums: The input list of integers.

    Returns:
        The single number that appears only once.
    """

## Problem Description

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## Approach(es)

### Bit Manipulation (XOR) Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `result = 0`.
2.  Iterate through the `nums` array:
    *   XOR `result` with the current number (`result ^= num`).
3.  Return `result`.

Explanation:

The XOR operation has the following properties:

*   `x ^ 0 = x` (XOR with 0 returns the original number)
*   `x ^ x = 0` (XOR of a number with itself is 0)
*   XOR is associative and commutative: `(x ^ y) ^ z = x ^ (y ^ z)` and `x ^ y = y ^ x`

Because of these properties, when we XOR all the numbers in the array, the pairs of duplicate numbers will cancel each other out (resulting in 0), and we'll be left with the single number XORed with 0, which is the single number itself.

Data Structures:

*   None (just a single integer variable for the result)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - We use only constant extra space (the `result` variable).

Trade-offs:

* This is a very efficient approach, using both minimal time and space.

## Notes

* This problem is a classic example of using the XOR operation for a clever and efficient solution.  It demonstrates how understanding bitwise operations can lead to optimized algorithms.
* Other less efficient methods (like using hash map) does not meet the space complexity required.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic Extraction.
*Analysis*: "Bit Manipulation" is the primary topic. We can also consider "Arrays".

*   `Bit Manipulation.md`: (This was created in a previous turn, we reuse it.)
*   `Array.md`: (This was created in a previous turn; we reuse it).

This completes the repository, including a highly efficient XOR-based solution, a clear README, and links to the relevant topic explanations.  It adheres to all constraints and instructions.
