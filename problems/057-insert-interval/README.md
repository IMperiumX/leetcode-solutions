# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science. They are contiguous blocks of memory that store a collection of elements of the same data type.  Arrays provide efficient access to elements based on their index (position).

## Characteristics of Arrays

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements are stored next to each other in memory. This allows for fast access using index calculations.
*   **Fixed Size (in many languages):**  Traditional arrays have a fixed size determined at creation time.  Dynamic arrays (like Python's `list`) can grow or shrink, but this often involves memory reallocation.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:**  Typically, all elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all floats, all strings).  Some languages (like Python) allow for heterogeneous arrays (different data types), but this comes with performance considerations.
*   **Indexed Access:** Elements are accessed using their index, which is an integer representing their position in the array.  Indexing usually starts at 0 (zero-based indexing).

## Operations and Time Complexity

*   **Access (by index):** O(1) -  Accessing an element at a known index is very fast because it involves a simple memory address calculation.
*   **Insertion (at the end):**
    *   O(1) for dynamic arrays (amortized) - If there's space available, appending is fast.
    *   O(n) for fixed-size arrays - If the array is full, a new, larger array must be created, and all elements copied over.
*   **Insertion (at the beginning or middle):** O(n) - Elements need to be shifted to make space for the new element.
*   **Deletion (at the end):**
    *   O(1) for dynamic arrays (amortized) - Removing the last element is usually fast.
    *   O(1) for fixed-size arrays - just decrement the size.
*   **Deletion (at the beginning or middle):** O(n) - Elements need to be shifted to fill the gap.
*   **Search (unsorted array):** O(n) - Linear search: you might need to examine every element.
*   **Search (sorted array):** O(log n) - Binary search can be used for efficient searching.

## Advantages of Arrays

*   **Fast Access:** O(1) access by index.
*   **Simple to Implement:**  Arrays are relatively simple data structures to understand and use.
*   **Memory Efficiency (for dense data):**  If the array is mostly full, it uses memory efficiently because there's little overhead.

## Disadvantages of Arrays

*   **Fixed Size (in some languages):**  Can lead to wasted space if the array is not full, or require expensive resizing operations.
*   **Insertion/Deletion (at beginning/middle):** O(n) operations are slow.
*   **Inefficient for Sparse Data:** If the array is mostly empty, it wastes memory.

## Use Cases

*   **Storing and accessing sequences of data:**  Lists of numbers, characters, objects.
*   **Implementing other data structures:**  Stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables (often use arrays as underlying storage).
*   **Matrix operations:** Representing matrices and performing mathematical operations.
*   **Image processing:** Representing images as arrays of pixels.
*   **Game development:** Storing game maps, character positions, etc.

# 57. Insert Interval, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are given an array of non-overlapping `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `i`th interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

**Note** that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5`
*   `intervals` is sorted by `starti` in ascending order.
*   `newInterval.length == 2`
*   `0 <= start <= end <= 10^5`

## Approach(es)

### Standard Approach (Iterative Merging)

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty list `result` to store the merged intervals.
    *   Initialize an index `i` to 0 to iterate through the `intervals` array.
2.  **Add Non-Overlapping Intervals (Before):**
    *   While `i` is within the bounds of `intervals` and the end of the current interval (`intervals[i][1]`) is less than the start of `newInterval` (`newInterval[0]`):
        *   Add the current interval (`intervals[i]`) to `result`.
        *   Increment `i`.
    * These intervals come before `newInterval` and don't overlap.
3.  **Merge Overlapping Intervals:**
    *   While `i` is within the bounds of `intervals` and the start of the current interval (`intervals[i][0]`) is less than or equal to the end of `newInterval` (`newInterval[1]`):
        *   Update `newInterval`'s start to be the minimum of its current start and the current interval's start.
        *   Update `newInterval`'s end to be the maximum of its current end and the current interval's end.
        *   Increment `i`.
    * This step merges all intervals that overlap with `newInterval`.
4.  **Add the Merged Interval:**
    *   Add the (potentially merged) `newInterval` to `result`.
5.  **Add Non-Overlapping Intervals (After):**
    *   While `i` is within the bounds of `intervals`:
        *   Add the current interval (`intervals[i]`) to `result`.
        *   Increment `i`.
    * These intervals come after `newInterval` and don't overlap.

6.  **Return:** Return the `result` list.

Data Structures:

*   List (to store the resulting intervals).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of intervals in the `intervals` array.  We iterate through the array at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - In the worst case, the `result` list might contain all the original intervals plus the new interval (if there are no overlaps).  So, the space used is proportional to the input size.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is efficient and clearly handles the different cases of non-overlapping and overlapping intervals. The logic is straightforward to follow.

## Code

[Standard Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The key to solving this problem is to systematically handle the three cases: intervals before the new interval, intervals overlapping with the new interval, and intervals after the new interval.  The iterative approach with clear conditions makes this process efficient.
* The problem statement allows creating new array.
