# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science. They store collections of elements of the same data type, accessed using indices.  Understanding arrays is crucial for solving a wide variety of problems, particularly on platforms like LeetCode.

## Key Concepts

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient access to elements using their index (O(1) access time).
*   **Zero-Based Indexing:**  In most programming languages, array indices start at 0.  The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
*   **Fixed Size (in some languages):**  In languages like C/C++, arrays have a fixed size determined at compile time.  Dynamic arrays (like Python lists) can resize automatically.
*   **Mutability:** Arrays are typically mutable, meaning you can change the values of their elements after they are created.

## Common Array Operations

*   **Accessing Elements:**  Retrieving the value at a specific index (e.g., `arr[3]`).
*   **Updating Elements:**  Changing the value at a specific index (e.g., `arr[2] = 5`).
*   **Iteration:**  Looping through all elements of the array.
*   **Searching:**  Finding a specific element within the array (linear search, binary search on sorted arrays).
*   **Sorting:**  Arranging the elements in a specific order (ascending, descending).  Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
*   **Insertion/Deletion:** Adding or removing elements (more complex in fixed-size arrays, easier with dynamic arrays).

## Common Array Patterns in LeetCode

*   **Two Pointers:** Using two indices to traverse the array, often from opposite ends or moving at different speeds.
*   **Sliding Window:** Maintaining a "window" of elements within the array and moving it across the array.
*   **Prefix Sum:** Calculating the cumulative sum of elements up to each index, useful for range queries.
*   **Kadane's Algorithm:** Finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common and efficient approach for solving problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (usually indices) to traverse the data structure, often from opposite ends or moving at different speeds. This technique can significantly reduce time complexity compared to nested loops or brute-force approaches.

## Common Patterns

*   **Opposite Ends:** Two pointers start at the beginning and end of the data structure and move towards each other.  This is useful for problems like palindrome checking, finding pairs that sum to a target, or reversing an array in place.
*   **Same Direction (Fast and Slow):** Two pointers start at the same position but move at different speeds. This is often used in linked list problems to detect cycles, find the middle element, or find the nth element from the end.
*   **Sliding Window:** Two pointers define a "window" within the data structure, and the window slides across the data. This is helpful for problems involving subarrays or substrings, such as finding the longest substring with unique characters or finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a given size.
*    **Multiple Arrays/Strings:** Two pointers traverse separate arrays/strings.

## Advantages of Two Pointers

*   **Efficiency:** Can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) or from O(n log n) to O(n).
*   **Space Efficiency:** Often requires only constant extra space (O(1)).
*   **Readability:** Can make code more concise and easier to understand compared to nested loops.

## When to Consider Two Pointers

*   The problem involves arrays, strings, or linked lists.
*   The problem requires finding a pair, a subsequence, or a specific condition that involves comparing elements at different positions.
*   The data structure is sorted (but not always required).
*   In-place modification is desired (for problems like reversing or removing elements).

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving those subproblems only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. It's particularly effective for problems that exhibit the properties of **optimal substructure** and **overlapping subproblems**.

## Key Concepts

*   **Optimal Substructure:** A problem has optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
*   **Overlapping Subproblems:** A problem has overlapping subproblems if the same subproblems are solved multiple times during the recursive solution.  DP avoids recomputing these subproblems by storing their solutions.
*   **Memoization (Top-Down):**  A recursive approach where we store the results of subproblems as they are computed, typically in a hash table or array.
*   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**  An iterative approach where we build up solutions to subproblems in a table (usually an array), starting with the smallest subproblems and working our way up to the main problem.

## Steps to Solve a DP Problem

1.  **Identify Optimal Substructure:**  Determine how an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.
2.  **Define a Recursive Relation:** Formulate a recursive relation (a recurrence) that expresses the solution to a subproblem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems.  This is often the most challenging step.
3.  **Choose Memoization or Tabulation:** Decide whether to use a top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approach.
4.  **Implement the Solution:**
    *   **Memoization:** Write a recursive function that checks if a subproblem's solution is already stored. If so, return it; otherwise, compute it, store it, and then return it.
    *   **Tabulation:** Create a table (usually an array) to store solutions to subproblems.  Iteratively fill the table, starting with the base cases and using the recursive relation to compute larger subproblems.
5.  **Determine Time and Space Complexity:** Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.  DP often trades space for time.

## Advantages of Dynamic Programming

*   **Efficiency:** Avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing subproblem solutions, leading to significant performance improvements.
*   **Optimality:** Guarantees finding the optimal solution for problems with optimal substructure.

## Disadvantages of Dynamic Programming

*   **Space Complexity:**  Can require significant memory to store subproblem solutions, especially for problems with many subproblems.
*   **Complexity:**  Designing DP solutions can be challenging, requiring careful analysis of the problem's structure.

# Stacks

Stacks are a fundamental linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.  The last element added to the stack is the first element removed.  Think of a stack of plates – you add plates to the top and remove plates from the top.

## Key Concepts

*   **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** The element most recently added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
*   **Push:**  Adding an element to the top of the stack.
*   **Pop:** Removing the element from the top of the stack.
*   **Peek (or Top):**  Retrieving the value of the top element without removing it.
*   **isEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
*   **isFull:** Checking if the stack is full (relevant for array-based implementations with a fixed size).

## Common Stack Operations

*   **push(element):** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
*   **pop():** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
*   **peek():** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
*   **empty():** Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Implementations

*   **Array-based:** Stacks can be implemented using arrays.  In this case, the stack has a fixed capacity.
*   **Linked List-based:** Stacks can also be implemented using linked lists.  This allows for dynamic resizing.  Each node in the linked list represents an element in the stack.

## Common Stack Applications

*   **Function Call Stack:**  Used by programming languages to manage function calls.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:**  Storing previous states of an application.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Evaluating arithmetic expressions (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
*   **Backtracking Algorithms:**  Exploring different solution paths (e.g., solving mazes).
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Traversing graphs and trees.
*   **Design Problems:** Implementing specialized stacks, like the Min Stack.

# 42. Trapping Rain Water, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105

## Approach(es)

### Two Pointers Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the start and end of the `height` array, respectively.
2.  Initialize `left_max` and `right_max` to 0, representing the maximum height encountered so far from the left and right sides.
3.  Initialize `water` to 0, to store the total trapped water.
4.  While `left < right`:
    *   If `height[left] < height[right]` (the left side is the limiting factor):
        *   If `height[left] >= left_max`, update `left_max` to `height[left]` (no water trapped).
        *   Else, add `left_max - height[left]` to `water` (water is trapped).
        *   Increment `left`.
    *   Else (the right side is the limiting factor or equal):
        *   If `height[right] >= right_max`, update `right_max` to `height[right]` (no water trapped).
        *   Else, add `right_max - height[right]` to `water` (water is trapped).
        *   Decrement `right`.
5.  Return `water`.

Data Structures:

*   No extra data structures are used beyond a few variables.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the `height` array. We iterate through the array once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is very efficient in both time and space. It cleverly uses two pointers to avoid redundant calculations.

### Dynamic Programming (Precomputed Max Heights)

Algorithm:

1.  Create two arrays, `left_max` and `right_max`, of the same size as `height`.
2.  **Calculate `left_max`:**
    *   `left_max[0] = height[0]`
    *   For each `i` from 1 to n-1: `left_max[i] = max(height[i], left_max[i-1])`
3.  **Calculate `right_max`:**
    *   `right_max[n-1] = height[n-1]`
    *   For each `i` from n-2 down to 0: `right_max[i] = max(height[i], right_max[i+1])`
4.  **Calculate Trapped Water:**
    *   Initialize `water` to 0.
    *   For each `i` from 0 to n-1: `water += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]`
5.  Return `water`.

Data Structures:

*   Two arrays: `left_max` and `right_max`.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the `height` array.  We iterate through the array three times.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n), as we use two extra arrays of size n.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is less space-efficient than the two-pointer approach but is still linear in time. It's easier to understand the logic, as it explicitly precomputes the maximum heights.
### Stack Based Approach
Algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack to store indices of bars.
2. Initialize water = 0 to store the total trapped water.
3. Iterate over the height array:
      While the stack is not empty and the current bar is taller than the bar at the top of the stack:
        Pop the top index from the stack (top). This represents the bar that might be bounded by water.
        If the stack becomes empty, break the inner loop. There's no left bound to trap water.
        Calculate the distance between the current bar and the bar now at the top of the stack.
        Calculate the bounded_height, which is the minimum of the current bar's height and the new top of the stack's height, minus the height of the popped bar (top).
        Add distance * bounded_height to water.
      Push the current bar's index onto the stack.
4. Return water.

Data Structures:
    * Stack

Time Complexity:
* O(n)

Space Complexity:
* O(n)

Trade-offs:
     * Less efficient in terms of space compared to the Two Pointers method

[Dynamic Programming Approach](./solution_dp.py)
[Stack Based Approach](./solution_stack.py)

## Notes

The two-pointer approach is the most efficient solution for this problem, offering O(1) space complexity. The dynamic programming approach is a good alternative if you prefer a more structured way to precompute maximum heights, but it uses O(n) extra space.  The problem highlights the importance of considering different approaches and choosing the most efficient one based on the constraints. The core concept is that the amount of water trapped at a given bar is determined by the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right, minus the height of the bar itself.
