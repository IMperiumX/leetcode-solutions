# 11. Container With Most Water, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i<sup>th</sup> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the *maximum amount of water* a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
Output: `49`
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

Input: `height = [1,1]`
Output: `1`

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Approach(es)

### Two-Pointer Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end of the array. Initialize `max_area` to 0.
2.  **Iteration:** While `left < right`:
    *   Calculate the current area: `current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`.
    *   Update `max_area`: `max_area = max(max_area, current_area)`.
    *   **Move the Pointer:** Move the pointer that points to the *shorter* line inward.  The intuition is that moving the pointer pointing to the shorter line has the potential to increase the area, while moving the pointer pointing to the taller line will *always* decrease or keep constant the area (since the width decreases, and the height is limited by the shorter line).

**Data Structures:**

*   No extra data structures are needed beyond a few integer variables.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n), where `n` is the length of the `height` array. We iterate through the array once with the two pointers.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) - Constant extra space.

**Trade-offs:**

* This approach is highly efficient in both time and space. The key insight is to realize that moving the pointer pointing to the smaller height is the only way to potentially increase the area.

# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures, storing collections of elements of the *same data type*, accessed via an index.

**Key Properties:**

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
*   **Fixed Size (Often):**  In many languages, array size is fixed at compile time. Dynamic arrays (like Python lists) resize, with a performance cost.
*   **Zero-Based Indexing (Usually):** The first element is at index 0.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:** Elements are usually of the same data type.

**Common Operations (Time Complexities):**

*   **Access (by index):** O(1)
*   **Insertion (at end, dynamic arrays):** Amortized O(1)
*   **Insertion (specific index):** O(n)
*   **Deletion (specific index):** O(n)
*   **Search (unsorted):** O(n)
*   **Search (sorted):** O(log n) - Binary Search

**Python Lists:**

Python's `list` is a dynamic array.

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists, often reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). It involves using two pointers (indices) that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner.

**Common Patterns:**

1.  **Opposite Direction:** Two pointers start at opposite ends of an array and move towards each other. This is often used in problems involving sorted arrays or searching for pairs that satisfy a certain condition.
2.  **Same Direction:** Two pointers start at the same position and move in the same direction, but potentially at different speeds. This is commonly used in problems involving finding subarrays, linked list cycles, or sliding windows.
3.  **Fast and Slow Pointers:**  A special case of the same-direction pattern, where one pointer (the "fast" pointer) moves faster than the other pointer (the "slow" pointer).  This is very useful for linked list problems (e.g., detecting cycles, finding the middle node).

**Example (Opposite Direction - 11. Container With Most Water):**

The "Container With Most Water" problem is a classic example of the opposite-direction two-pointer technique.  We initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `n-1`.  At each step, we calculate the area and then *move the pointer pointing to the shorter line*. This is the key insight that makes the algorithm efficient.

**Example (Same Direction - Sliding Window):**

Many "sliding window" problems use the same-direction two-pointer technique. One pointer defines the start of the window, and the other defines the end. The window "slides" through the array, and we maintain some information about the elements within the window.

**Example (Fast and Slow Pointers - Linked List Cycle Detection):**

In linked list cycle detection, the fast pointer moves two steps at a time, and the slow pointer moves one step at a time. If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.
