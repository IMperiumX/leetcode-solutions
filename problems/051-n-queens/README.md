# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

## How Backtracking Works

1.  **Start with a partial solution:** Begin with an empty or partially filled solution.
2.  **Extend the solution:**  Try to extend the current partial solution by adding a new element (e.g., placing a queen in a new row in the N-Queens problem, choosing a next move in a maze).
3.  **Check for validity:**  Check if the extended solution is still valid according to the problem's constraints.
4.  **Recurse or Backtrack:**
    *   If the extended solution is valid and complete, add it to the set of solutions.
    *   If the extended solution is valid but not complete, recursively call the backtracking function with the extended solution.
    *   If the extended solution is invalid, "backtrack" by removing the last added element and trying a different option.

## Key Concepts

*   **State Space Tree:**  Backtracking can be visualized as exploring a state space tree, where each node represents a partial solution, and the children of a node represent possible extensions of that solution.
*   **Pruning:**  The efficiency of backtracking comes from its ability to "prune" the search space by abandoning partial solutions that are known to be invalid. This avoids exploring large parts of the state space tree that cannot lead to valid solutions.
* **Recursion:** Most of the times is used with recursion.

## Example: N-Queens Problem

In the N-Queens problem, backtracking can be used as follows:

1.  Start with an empty chessboard.
2.  Try to place a queen in the first row.
3.  For each column in the first row:
    *   If placing a queen in the current column is safe (doesn't attack other queens), place the queen.
    *   Recursively try to place queens in the remaining rows.
    *   If the recursive call returns a solution, add it to the list of solutions.
    *   Remove the queen from the current column (backtrack) and try the next column.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of backtracking algorithms is highly dependent on the specific problem and the effectiveness of the pruning. In the worst case, it can be exponential (e.g., O(2^n) or O(n!)), but in practice, good pruning can significantly reduce the search space. For example The N-Queens problem has a time complexity of O(N!).

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is generally O(N) due to the recursive calls on the stack.

## Advantages of Backtracking

*   **Finds All Solutions:** Can be used to find all possible solutions to a problem.
*   **Relatively Simple to Implement:**  The recursive structure often makes the implementation straightforward.
*   **Can Be Efficient (with good pruning):** For problems with many constraints, backtracking can be much more efficient than brute-force approaches.

## Disadvantages of Backtracking

*   **Can Be Slow (without good pruning):**  If the pruning is not effective, backtracking can explore a very large search space, leading to long running times.
* **Exponential complexity**

## Use Cases

*   **N-Queens Problem:** Placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
*   **Sudoku Solver:**  Filling a Sudoku grid.
*   **Maze Solving:**  Finding a path through a maze.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction Problems:**  Finding assignments of values to variables that satisfy a set of constraints.
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:** Finding optimal solutions in problems with a large number of possible combinations.
* **Generating all possible combinations**

# 51. N-Queens, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

The **n-queens puzzle** is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return *all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle***. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 9`

## Approach(es)

### Backtracking

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialize:** Create an empty `n x n` chessboard represented as a 2D list (list of lists) filled with '.' characters.
2.  **`is_safe(row, col)` Function:** Create a helper function `is_safe(row, col)` that checks if it's safe to place a queen at the given `row` and `col`. This function checks:
    *   The same column: If there's a queen in any row of the same column.
    *   The upper-left diagonal: If there's a queen in the upper-left diagonal.
    *   The upper-right diagonal: If there's a queen in the upper-right diagonal.
3.  **`solve_nqueens_util(row)` Function (Recursive):**
    *   **Base Case:** If `row == n`, it means we have successfully placed queens in all rows. Convert the current board configuration to a list of strings and add it to the `result` list.
    *   **Iterate Through Columns:** For each column `col` in the current `row`:
        *   If `is_safe(row, col)` returns `True`:
            *   Place a queen at `board[row][col] = 'Q'`.
            *   Recursively call `solve_nqueens_util(row + 1)` to try placing queens in the next row.
            *   **Backtrack:** Remove the queen from `board[row][col] = '.'` to explore other possibilities.
4.  **Main Function (`solveNQueens`):**
    *  Initialize result list.
    *   Call the recursive helper function `solve_nqueens_util(0)` to start the backtracking process from the first row (row 0).
    *   Return the `result` list.

Data Structures:

*   2D List (List of Lists): To represent the chessboard.
*   Recursion (implicit stack).

Time Complexity:

*   O(N!) -  There are N possibilities for the first row, N-2 for the second row (at most, some placements become invalid).

Space Complexity:

*   O(N^2) -  To store the board. O(N) for recursive stack

Trade-offs:

*   Backtracking is the standard approach for solving the N-Queens problem. It systematically explores the solution space and prunes branches that are guaranteed to be invalid, making it more efficient than a brute-force approach.

## Code

[Backtracking Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The `is_safe` function is crucial for efficiently checking the validity of placing a queen at a particular position.
*   The backtracking step (`board[row][col] = '.'`) is essential to explore all possible configurations. Without backtracking, we would only find one solution (or no solution).
*   The conversion of the board to a list of strings is done only when a complete solution is found (base case of the recursion).
