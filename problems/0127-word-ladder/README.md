Okay, let's create the solution, README, and topic files for LeetCode problem 127: "Word Ladder".  This is a classic graph problem best solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 127
*   **Problem Name:** Word Ladder
*   **Difficulty:** Hard

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

I'll create a folder named `0127-word-ladder`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

The core idea is to treat the words as nodes in a graph, where an edge exists between two words if they differ by only one letter. We then use BFS to find the shortest path from `beginWord` to `endWord`.  To optimize the process of finding neighbors (words differing by one letter), we'll use a preprocessing step to create a dictionary that maps patterns (like "h\*t") to words that match that pattern.

                    queue.append((neighbor, level + 1))

# 127. Word Ladder, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

A *transformation sequence* from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

-   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
-   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does *not* need to be in `wordList`.
-   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the *number of words* in the **shortest** transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which is 5 words long.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
-   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
-   `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
-   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
-   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
-   `beginWord != endWord`
-   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

## Approach(es)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Preprocessing

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Check for `endWord`:** If `endWord` is not in `wordList`, there's no possible transformation, so return 0.
2.  **Preprocessing (Build Pattern Dictionary):**
    -   Create a dictionary `word_patterns` where:
        -   Keys are patterns formed by replacing one letter of a word with a wildcard character (e.g., "h\*t", "*ot", "ho\*").
        -   Values are lists of words from `wordList` that match that pattern.
    -   For each `word` in `wordList`:
        -   For each index `i` in `word`:
            -   Create the pattern `word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]`.
            -   Append `word` to the list associated with that pattern in `word_patterns`.
3.  **BFS Traversal:**
    -   Create a queue `queue` and initialize it with a tuple `(beginWord, 1)`, representing the starting word and its level (distance from `beginWord`).
    -   Create a set `visited` to keep track of visited words. Add `beginWord` to `visited`.
    -   While the `queue` is not empty:
        -   Dequeue a word and its level `(current_word, level)` from the `queue`.
        -   If `current_word` is equal to `endWord`, return `level` (we've found the shortest path).
        -   Generate all possible patterns for `current_word` (replace each letter with '\*').
        -   For each pattern:
            -   Look up the pattern in `word_patterns` to get a list of neighboring words.
            -   For each `neighbor` in the list:
                -   If `neighbor` has not been visited:
                    -   Add `neighbor` to `visited`.
                    -   Enqueue the tuple `(neighbor, level + 1)` into the `queue`.
4.  **No Path Found:** If the BFS completes without finding `endWord`, return 0.

**Data Structures:**

-   Dictionary (`word_patterns`):  `{pattern: [word1, word2, ...]}`
-   Queue (`queue`):  For BFS traversal.
-   Set (`visited`):  To track visited words.

**Time Complexity:**

-   Preprocessing: O(N \* M^2), where N is the number of words in `wordList` and M is the length of each word.  For each word, we iterate through its length (M) and create a pattern (which takes O(M) to create the string slice).
-   BFS: O(N \* M^2) in the worst case.  We might visit all words (N), and for each word, we generate M patterns, and potentially iterate through a list of words associated with each pattern. However, in practice it is often less than this theoretical worst case.
-   Overall: O(N \* M^2)

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(N \* M^2) for the `word_patterns` dictionary. In the worst case, each word could generate M different patterns, and each pattern could be associated with multiple words.
-   O(N) for the `visited` set.
-   O(N) for the queue in the worst case.

**Trade-offs:**

-   The preprocessing step (building `word_patterns`) significantly speeds up the neighbor-finding process during BFS. Without it, we'd have to compare each word with every other word in `wordList` to find neighbors, which would be much less efficient (O(N^2 * M)).
-   BFS guarantees finding the shortest path (transformation sequence).

## Notes

- This problem is a graph problem in disguise.  The words are nodes, and an edge exists between two words if they differ by one letter.
- BFS is the natural choice for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- The preprocessing step to create `word_patterns` is crucial for efficiency.  It avoids repeated string comparisons during the BFS.
- The use of a wildcard character ('\*') in the patterns allows us to efficiently group words that differ by only one letter.
