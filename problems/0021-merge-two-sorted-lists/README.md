# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Approach(es)

### Iterative Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Create a dummy node.  This simplifies the code, especially when handling the head of the merged list.
2.  Initialize a `tail` pointer to the dummy node.  This pointer will always point to the last node of the merged list.
3.  Iterate while both `list1` and `list2` are not empty:
    *   Compare the values of the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`.
    *   Append the node with the smaller value to the `tail.next`.
    *   Move the pointer of the list from which the node was appended to the next node.
    *   Move the `tail` pointer to the newly appended node.
4.  After one of the lists becomes empty, append the remaining nodes of the other list (if any) to `tail.next`.
5.  Return `dummy_head.next`, which is the head of the merged list.

Data Structures:

*   Linked List: The input and output are linked lists.

Time Complexity:

*   O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. We traverse both lists at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) -  We use constant extra space (dummy node and tail pointer). We are modifying the existing lists in place.  The iterative solution does *not* create new nodes for the merged list (except for the dummy head, which is constant space).

Trade-offs:
* Iterative approach good balance between time and memory.

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Base Cases:
    *   If `list1` is empty, return `list2`.
    *   If `list2` is empty, return `list1`.
2.  Recursive Step:
    *   Compare the values of the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`.
    *   If `list1.val` is smaller or equal, recursively merge `list1.next` and `list2`, and set the result as `list1.next`.  Return `list1`.
    *   Otherwise, recursively merge `list1` and `list2.next`, and set the result as `list2.next`. Return `list2`.

Data Structures:

*   Linked List

Time Complexity:

*   O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`.  Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(m + n) - due to recursive calls. In the worst-case scenario (e.g., highly skewed lists), the recursion depth can be equal to the sum of the lengths of the two lists.  This is because each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.

Trade-offs:

*   The recursive approach can be more concise and easier to read for some people, but it uses more space due to the call stack.
* The iterative solution is generally preferred for its constant space complexity.

## Code

[Iterative Approach](./solution.py)
[Recursive Approach](./solution_recursive.py)

## Notes

*   Both iterative and recursive approaches are common solutions.
*   The iterative approach is generally preferred due to its O(1) space complexity.
*   The dummy node technique is a useful pattern for simplifying linked list manipulation.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic Extraction from solution and problem description.
*Analysis*: The problem clearly involves "Linked List" and "Recursion" (for the recursive solution). Also, "Two Pointers" can be associated with iterative solution.

* Create a file named `Linked List.md`.

```markdown
# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains a value and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.

## Types of Linked Lists

*   **Singly Linked List:** Each node has a pointer to the next node only.
*   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
*   **Circular Linked List:** The last node's pointer points back to the first node, forming a cycle.

## Advantages of Linked Lists

*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as needed, unlike arrays which have a fixed size (or require resizing).
*   **Efficient Insertion and Deletion:** Inserting or deleting a node in a linked list only requires updating pointers, which can be done in O(1) time if you have a pointer to the node before the insertion/deletion point. In contrast, inserting or deleting in the middle of an array can require shifting elements, which takes O(n) time.
* **No wasted space:** Because a linked list only takes memory space that it is using.

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

*   **No Random Access:** Accessing an element at a specific index in a linked list requires traversing the list from the beginning, which takes O(n) time. Arrays allow O(1) random access.
*   **Extra Memory Overhead:** Each node in a linked list requires extra memory to store the pointer(s).
*   **Cache Inefficiency:** Due to non-contiguous memory allocation, linked lists can have poor cache performance compared to arrays.

## Common Linked List Operations

*   **Traversal:** Visiting each node in the list.
*   **Insertion:** Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
*   **Deletion:** Removing a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
*   **Searching:** Finding a node with a specific value.
*   **Reversal:** Reversing the order of the nodes in the list.

# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. A recursive function typically consists of two main parts:

1.  **Base Case(s):** One or more conditions that stop the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
2.  **Recursive Step:** The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified input, moving towards the base case.

## How Recursion Works

Each time a function calls itself, a new frame is added to the call stack. This frame contains the function's local variables and parameters for that particular call. When the base case is reached, the function returns a value, and the corresponding frame is removed from the stack. The process continues until the initial call returns, and the stack is empty.

## Advantages of Recursion

*   **Elegance and Readability:** Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to understand for problems that have a naturally recursive structure (e.g., tree traversal, factorial).
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Recursion allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

## Disadvantages of Recursion

*   **Stack Overflow:** Excessive recursion depth can lead to a stack overflow error, especially if the base case is not reached or the problem size is too large.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Function calls have overhead, so recursive solutions can sometimes be slower than iterative solutions.
*   **Memory Usage:** Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which can consume significant memory for deep recursion.

## Types of Recursion

*   **Direct Recursion:** A function calls itself directly.
*   **Indirect Recursion:** A function calls another function, which eventually calls the original function.
*   **Tail Recursion:** The recursive call is the very last operation performed in the function. Some compilers can optimize tail-recursive functions to avoid stack overflow errors.

## When to Use Recursion

Recursion is well-suited for problems that have a recursive structure, such as:

*   Tree and graph traversals
*   Divide and conquer algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort)
*   Fractals and other self-similar structures
*   Combinatorial problems

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (variables that hold indices or references) to traverse the data structure, often in a coordinated way.

## Common Two Pointers Patterns

*   **Opposite Directions:** The two pointers start at opposite ends of the data structure (e.g., beginning and end of an array) and move towards each other. This is often used for problems involving sorted arrays or palindromes.
*   **Same Direction:** Both pointers start at the same position (e.g., the beginning of the data structure) and move in the same direction, but potentially at different speeds. This is common in problems like finding cycles in linked lists or sliding window problems.
*   **Fast and Slow Pointers:** A variation of the "Same Direction" pattern where one pointer (the fast pointer) moves faster than the other (the slow pointer). This is very useful for linked list problems, such as finding the middle node or detecting cycles.
* **Maintain a window**: When there is a need to keep a track of sub-array.

## Advantages of Two Pointers

*   **Efficiency:** Two pointers can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) or from O(n log n) to O(n) by avoiding nested loops or unnecessary sorting.
*   **Space Efficiency:** Two pointers typically use constant extra space (O(1)), as they only store a few pointer variables.

## When to Use Two Pointers

*   Problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists.
*   Problems where you need to find a pair, triplet, or subarray that satisfies a certain condition.
*   Problems involving reversing or manipulating a data structure in place.
*   Problems that can be solved by comparing or tracking elements from different parts of the data structure.
* Find a pair in sorted array which gives sum X.

* The time complexity of the provided `mergeTwoLists` function is **O(n + m)**, where:
* **n** is the number of nodes in `list1`.
* **m** is the number of nodes in `list2`.

### Explanation

  The function merges two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted linked list. Here's why the time complexity is O(n + m):

  1. **Initialization**:

* A dummy node is created to simplify edge cases, and a `current` pointer is initialized to this dummy node.

   2. **Merging Process**:

* The `while` loop runs as long as both `list1` and `list2` have nodes.
* In each iteration:
  * It compares the values of the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`.
  * Appends the smaller node to the merged list by setting `current.next`.
  * Moves the pointer (`list1` or `list2`) forward.
  * Advances the `current` pointer.

    3. **Appending Remaining Nodes**:
* After one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining nodes of the other list are appended to the merged list.
* This ensures that all nodes from both lists are included.

### Time Complexity Breakdown

* **Comparisons and Node Linking**:
  * Each node from both lists is visited exactly once.
  * For each node, only constant time operations are performed (comparison and pointer assignment).
* **Total Operations**:
  * The total number of iterations in the `while` loop is proportional to the total number of nodes in both lists.
  * After the loop, appending the remaining nodes is also proportional to the number of remaining nodes.
* **Overall Complexity**:
  * Since each of the **n** and **m** nodes is processed once, the total time complexity is **O(n + m)**.

### Conclusion

  The function efficiently merges the two lists by only traversing each node once, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the sizes of the input lists.

  **Answer:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input lists; each node is processed once.

---

* The space complexity of the provided `mergeTwoLists` function is **O(1)**, which means it uses constant extra space regardless of the input sizes.

### Explanation

  The function merges two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted linked list by rearranging the existing nodes. Here's a detailed breakdown of the space usage:

1. **Initialization**:

* **Dummy Node**: A single dummy node is created using `ListNode(0)`. This node serves as the starting point of the merged list and simplifies edge cases.
* **Pointers**:
  * `current`: A pointer initialized to the dummy node. It is used to build the merged list.
  * `list1`, `list2`: Pointers to traverse the input lists.
* All these pointers and the dummy node consume **constant space**.

2. **Merging Process**:

* The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the nodes of `list1` and `list2`.
* It compares the values of the current nodes and adjusts the `next` pointers to build the merged list.
* **No new nodes are created during this process**; the existing nodes from `list1` and `list2` are rearranged.
* All operations within the loop are done **in-place**, using existing nodes and pointers.

3. **Appending Remaining Nodes**:

* After one of the lists is exhausted, the function appends the remaining nodes of the other list to the merged list.
* This is done by pointing `current.next` to the remaining nodes.
* Again, **no additional space** is required for this step.

### Space Complexity Breakdown

* **Extra Space Used**:
  * **Dummy Node**: One node (`ListNode`) is created, which requires constant space **O(1)**.
  * **Pointers/Variables**: The function uses a fixed number of variables (`current`, `list1`, `list2`), each consuming constant space.
* **In-Place Operations**:
  * The function rearranges the `next` pointers of existing nodes. It doesn't allocate additional space proportional to the input sizes.
  * All modifications are made directly on the input lists' nodes.
* **Overall Space Complexity**:
  * Since the extra space used does not depend on the lengths of `list1` or `list2`, it is considered **constant space**.
  * **Space Complexity: O(1)**.

### Conclusion

  The function effectively merges two lists by reusing and rearranging existing nodes without allocating significant additional space. It only uses a small, constant amount of extra space for the dummy node and a few pointers.
