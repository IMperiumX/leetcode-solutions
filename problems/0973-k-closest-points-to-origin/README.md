# 973. K Closest Points to Origin, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104

## Approach(es)

### Sorting Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Calculate the squared Euclidean distance for each point (no need to take the square root, as we're only comparing distances). Store the distances along with their corresponding points in a list of tuples: `[(distance, point), ...]`.
2.  Sort the list of tuples based on the distances (the first element of each tuple).
3.  Extract the first `k` points from the sorted list.

Data Structures:

*   List of tuples

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n) - Dominated by the sorting step, where n is the number of points.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - We create a new list to store the distances and points.

Trade-offs:

* Simple to implement, but not the most efficient for very large datasets.

### Heap (Priority Queue) Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Use a min-heap (priority queue) to store the points based on their distances from the origin. In Python, we use the `heapq` module.
2.  Iterate through the `points`:
    *   Calculate the squared Euclidean distance for the current point.
    *   Push a tuple `(distance, point)` onto the min-heap.  The heap will automatically maintain the elements in sorted order based on the distance (the first element of the tuple).
3.  After processing all points, extract the `k` smallest elements (closest points) from the min-heap using `heapq.heappop()`.

Data Structures:

*   Min-Heap (Priority Queue)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log k) on average.  Building the initial heap takes O(n log k) time in the worst case.  Each `heappush` and `heappop` operation takes O(log k) time (because the heap size is at most `k`). We perform `n` pushes and `k` pops. When n is much bigger than k, the dominant factor will be push, so complexity is close to O(n log k). If k is close to n then, the dominant factor would be pop, so complexity is O(k log k) ~ O(n log n)

Space Complexity:

*   O(k) - The heap will store at most `k` elements.

Trade-offs:

*   More efficient than sorting for large datasets when `k` is much smaller than `n`.
*   Requires understanding of heaps/priority queues.

[Heap Approach](./solution_heap.py)

## Notes

* The heap-based approach is generally preferred when `k` is significantly smaller than `n`, as it avoids sorting the entire list of points.
* We use the squared Euclidean distance instead of the actual Euclidean distance to avoid the computationally expensive square root operation. The relative order of distances is preserved whether we use the squared distance or the actual distance.
* This problem is a good example of using a priority queue (heap) to efficiently find the k smallest or largest elements in a collection.
* The QuickSelect algorithm could also be used to solve the problem in average O(n) time, but with a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), so we did not included it here.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic extraction.
*Analysis:* Relevant topics are "Arrays", "Sorting", "Heap (Priority Queue)", "Divide and Conquer" (for QuickSelect, mentioned in Notes), and "Math" (for the Euclidean distance calculation).

*   `Arrays.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Sorting.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Math.md` (already exists, reuse)

*   Create `Heap (Priority Queue).md`:

# Heap (Priority Queue)

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.  The heap property states that for a *min-heap*, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root.  For a *max-heap*, the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root.

Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.  A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a "priority" associated with it.  Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.

## Types of Heaps

*   **Min-Heap:**  The value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent. The minimum element is at the root.
*   **Max-Heap:**  The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent. The maximum element is at the root.

## Heap Operations

*   **Insert (push):**  Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.  Typically O(log n) time.
*   **Delete Min/Max (pop):**  Removes and returns the minimum element (for a min-heap) or the maximum element (for a max-heap) while maintaining the heap property.  Typically O(log n) time.
*   **Peek (find-min/find-max):**  Returns the minimum element (for a min-heap) or the maximum element (for a max-heap) without removing it.  Typically O(1) time.
*   **Heapify:**  Transforms a list into a heap in-place.  Can be done in O(n) time.

## Heap Implementation

Heaps are usually implemented using arrays.  The relationship between parent and child nodes is determined by their indices in the array:

*   For a node at index `i`:
    *   Left child: `2i + 1`
    *   Right child: `2i + 2`
    *   Parent: `(i - 1) // 2`

## Advantages of Heaps

*   **Efficient Priority Queue Implementation:**  Heaps provide efficient operations for finding and removing the minimum or maximum element.
*   **Guaranteed Logarithmic Time Complexity:**  Insert and delete operations have O(log n) time complexity.
* **In place Heapify**

## Disadvantages of Heaps

*   **Not Suitable for Searching:**  Heaps are not designed for efficient searching for arbitrary elements (use hash tables or other data structures for that).
*   **Only Min/Max Access:** Heaps only provide efficient access to the minimum or maximum element, not other elements.

## Python's `heapq` Module

Python provides the `heapq` module for working with heaps.  It implements a min-heap.

*   `heapq.heappush(heap, item)`: Pushes an item onto the heap.
*   `heapq.heappop(heap)`: Pops and returns the smallest item from the heap.
*   `heapq.heapify(list)`: Transforms a list into a heap in-place.
*   `heapq.nlargest(n, iterable)`: Returns a list with the n largest elements from the iterable.
*   `heapq.nsmallest(n, iterable)`: Returns a list with the n smallest elements from the iterable.

# Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by recursively breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type, solving the subproblems independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

## Steps in Divide and Conquer

1.  **Divide:** Break the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type.
2.  **Conquer:** Recursively solve the subproblems. If the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly (base case).
3.  **Combine:** Combine the solutions to the subproblems to obtain the solution to the original problem.

## Characteristics of Divide and Conquer Algorithms

*   **Recursion:** Divide and Conquer algorithms are typically implemented using recursion.
*   **Independent Subproblems:** The subproblems must be independent of each other (no overlapping subproblems). If there are overlapping subproblems, dynamic programming is usually a better approach.

## Advantages of Divide and Conquer

*   **Efficiency:** Divide and Conquer can often lead to more efficient algorithms (e.g., reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)).
*   **Parallelism:** The independent subproblems can often be solved in parallel, making Divide and Conquer suitable for parallel computing.

## Disadvantages of Divide and Conquer

*   **Overhead of Recursion:** Recursive calls can have some overhead, especially for very small subproblems.
*   **Complexity:**  Divide and Conquer algorithms can sometimes be more complex to design and implement than simpler iterative approaches.

## Examples of Divide and Conquer Algorithms

*   **Merge Sort:**  Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts the halves, and then merges the sorted halves.
*   **Quicksort:** Selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the subarrays.
*   **Binary Search:**  Searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
*   **Closest Pair of Points:**  Finds the closest pair of points in a set of points in a plane.
*   **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication:**  A faster algorithm for multiplying matrices.

## LeetCode Problems related to Divide and Conquer:
*   [23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
*  [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/) (can be solved with Divide and Conquer)
