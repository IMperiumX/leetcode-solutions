# 733. Flood Fill, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill:

Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

Example 1:

Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

Explanation:

From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.

Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.

Example 2:

Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0

Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

Explanation:

The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.

## Approach(es)

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Get the dimensions (rows and columns) of the image.
2.  Store the original color of the starting pixel.
3.  If the original color is the same as the new color, return the image unchanged (base case).
4.  Define a recursive helper function `dfs(row, col)`:
    *   **Base Case:** If the current row or column is out of bounds, or the current pixel's color is not equal to the original color, return.
    *   Change the color of the current pixel to the new color.
    *   Recursively call `dfs` on the four adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).
5.  Call the `dfs` function starting from the given starting pixel (`sr`, `sc`).
6.  Return the modified image.

Data Structures:

*   2D List (for the image)
*   Implicit call stack (for recursion)

Time Complexity:

*   O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the image. In the worst case, we might visit every pixel.

Space Complexity:

*   O(m * n) in the worst case due to the recursion depth.  This can happen if the entire image needs to be filled.  The average case is often much less than this.

Trade-offs:

* Recursive solution, more readable for some, but can have more memory usage in case of large input data.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Get the dimensions of the image.
2.  Store the original color of the starting pixel.
3.  If the original color is the same as the new color, return the image unchanged.
4.  Initialize a queue with the starting pixel coordinates (`sr`, `sc`).
5.  Change the color of the starting pixel to the new color.
6.  While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a pixel (row, col) from the front of the queue.
    *   For each of the four adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right):
        *   If the adjacent pixel is within the bounds of the image and has the original color:
            *   Change the color of the adjacent pixel to the new color.
            *   Enqueue the adjacent pixel's coordinates.
7.  Return the modified image.

Data Structures:

*   2D List (for the image)
*   Queue (for BFS)

Time Complexity:

*   O(m * n), similar to DFS.

Space Complexity:

*   O(m * n) in the worst case.  This occurs when the entire image needs to be filled, and all pixels are added to the queue.

Trade-offs:

* Iterative solution, usually more efficient for space than DFS.

## Code

[DFS Approach](./solution_dfs.py)
[BFS Approach](./solution_bfs.py)

## Notes

*   Both DFS and BFS are standard approaches for graph traversal and are suitable for this problem.
*   The BFS approach often has slightly better practical performance due to less function call overhead.
*  The choice between DFS and BFS often depends on personal preference and the specific problem constraints.
* This problem is a good illustration of how graph traversal algorithms can be applied to problems that don't explicitly involve graphs.  The image grid can be thought of as a graph where each pixel is a node, and adjacent pixels are connected by edges.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic extraction.
*Analysis:* The problem is related to "Graph Traversal" (specifically DFS and BFS), and "Array" (since the image is a 2D array).

*   Create a file named `Graph Traversal.md`.

# Graph Traversal

Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph.  Traversal algorithms are fundamental to solving many graph-related problems.

## Types of Graph Traversal

*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS uses a stack (often implemented implicitly via recursion) to keep track of the nodes to visit.

**Algorithm (Recursive):**

1.  Mark the current node as visited.
2.  For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.

**Algorithm (Iterative):**

1.  Push the starting node onto a stack.
2.  While the stack is not empty:
    *   Pop a node from the stack.
    *   If the node has not been visited:
        *   Mark the node as visited.
        *   Push all unvisited neighbors of the node onto the stack.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Enqueue the starting node into a queue.
2.  Mark the starting node as visited.
3.  While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a node from the queue.
    *   For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
        *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
        *   Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.

## Applications of Graph Traversal

*   **Finding connected components:** Identify groups of nodes that are reachable from each other.
*   **Topological sorting:** Order the nodes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A comes before node B in the ordering.
*   **Shortest path (BFS for unweighted graphs):** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
*   **Cycle detection:** Determine if a graph contains cycles.
* **Flood Fill**
* **Solving puzzles** (e.g., mazes)

# Array

An array is a fundamental data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array can be accessed using its index (position).  Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in computer science.

## Characteristics of Arrays

*   **Fixed Size (in most languages):**  The size of an array is typically determined at the time of creation and cannot be changed dynamically (in languages like C, C++, Java).  However, dynamic arrays (like `list` in Python or `ArrayList` in Java) provide the ability to resize.
*   **Contiguous Memory:**  Elements are stored in consecutive memory locations, which allows for efficient access.
*   **Random Access:**  Elements can be accessed directly using their index in O(1) time.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:** Typically, all elements in an array must be of the same data type.

## Common Array Operations

*   **Access:** Retrieving the value of an element at a specific index.
*   **Insertion:** Adding a new element to the array.  This can be O(n) in the worst case for static arrays (if insertion is not at the end) because it may require shifting existing elements.
*   **Deletion:** Removing an element from the array. Similar to insertion, this can be O(n) for static arrays.
*   **Searching:** Finding the index of a specific element in the array. Linear search is O(n), while binary search (for sorted arrays) is O(log n).
*   **Sorting:** Arranging the elements in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending). There are various sorting algorithms with different time complexities (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort).
* **Update:** update an element at specific index.

## Multidimensional Arrays

Arrays can have multiple dimensions.  A 2D array is commonly used to represent matrices or grids.  A 3D array can represent a cube of data, and so on.  Accessing elements in a multidimensional array requires multiple indices.

## Advantages of Arrays

*   **Fast Access:** O(1) random access to elements.
*   **Cache Friendly:** Due to contiguous memory allocation, arrays tend to have good cache performance.
*   **Simple to Implement:** Arrays are relatively simple to implement and use.

## Disadvantages of Arrays

*   **Fixed Size (Static Arrays):**  Resizing a static array can be expensive.
*   **Insertion/Deletion Cost:**  Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a static array can be O(n).
* **Memory waste:** If array is not filled to capacity.
