# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science. They are contiguous blocks of memory that store a collection of elements of the same data type.  Arrays provide efficient access to elements based on their index (position).

## Characteristics of Arrays

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements are stored next to each other in memory. This allows for fast access using index calculations.
*   **Fixed Size (in many languages):**  Traditional arrays have a fixed size determined at creation time.  Dynamic arrays (like Python's `list`) can grow or shrink, but this often involves memory reallocation.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:**  Typically, all elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all floats, all strings).  Some languages (like Python) allow for heterogeneous arrays (different data types), but this comes with performance considerations.
*   **Indexed Access:** Elements are accessed using their index, which is an integer representing their position in the array.  Indexing usually starts at 0 (zero-based indexing).

## Operations and Time Complexity

*   **Access (by index):** O(1) -  Accessing an element at a known index is very fast because it involves a simple memory address calculation.
*   **Insertion (at the end):**
    *   O(1) for dynamic arrays (amortized) - If there's space available, appending is fast.
    *   O(n) for fixed-size arrays - If the array is full, a new, larger array must be created, and all elements copied over.
*   **Insertion (at the beginning or middle):** O(n) - Elements need to be shifted to make space for the new element.
*   **Deletion (at the end):**
    *   O(1) for dynamic arrays (amortized) - Removing the last element is usually fast.
    *   O(1) for fixed-size arrays - just decrement the size.
*   **Deletion (at the beginning or middle):** O(n) - Elements need to be shifted to fill the gap.
*   **Search (unsorted array):** O(n) - Linear search: you might need to examine every element.
*   **Search (sorted array):** O(log n) - Binary search can be used for efficient searching.

## Advantages of Arrays

*   **Fast Access:** O(1) access by index.
*   **Simple to Implement:**  Arrays are relatively simple data structures to understand and use.
*   **Memory Efficiency (for dense data):**  If the array is mostly full, it uses memory efficiently because there's little overhead.

## Disadvantages of Arrays

*   **Fixed Size (in some languages):**  Can lead to wasted space if the array is not full, or require expensive resizing operations.
*   **Insertion/Deletion (at beginning/middle):** O(n) operations are slow.
*   **Inefficient for Sparse Data:** If the array is mostly empty, it wastes memory.

## Use Cases

*   **Storing and accessing sequences of data:**  Lists of numbers, characters, objects.
*   **Implementing other data structures:**  Stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables (often use arrays as underlying storage).
*   **Matrix operations:** Representing matrices and performing mathematical operations.
*   **Image processing:** Representing images as arrays of pixels.
*   **Game development:** Storing game maps, character positions, etc.

# 283. Move Zeroes, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place **without making a copy of the array**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
*   `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## Approach(es)

### Two-Pointer Approach (Optimal)

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize a `slow` pointer to 0. This pointer will track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the array using a `fast` pointer:
    *   If `nums[fast]` is not zero:
        *   Swap `nums[slow]` and `nums[fast]`.
        *   Increment `slow` to point to the next position for a non-zero element.
3.  The `fast` pointer continues to scan the array.  The `slow` pointer only moves when a non-zero element is encountered.  After the loop, all non-zero elements will be in their correct relative order at the beginning of the array, and all zeros will be at the end.

Data Structures:

*   Array (in-place modification).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - We modify the array in-place, using only constant extra space.

Trade-offs:

*   This is the optimal approach in terms of both time and space complexity.  It minimizes the number of operations by only swapping when necessary.

### Suboptimal Approach

Algorithm:

1. **Append Zeros:** loop over the array length, if find zero append it to end of the array.
2. **Remove zeros from original positions:** loop over the original array length and keep track of the last non-zero position, if found a zero at the position, then remove it.

Data Structures:

*  Array

Time Complexity:

* O(n^2)

Space Complexity:

*   O(1)

Trade-offs:
*  This is very bad solution in therms of time.

[Suboptimal Approach](./solution_suboptimal.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The key to solving this problem efficiently is to avoid unnecessary operations. The two-pointer approach achieves this by only swapping non-zero elements into their correct positions.
*   The follow-up question about minimizing operations is directly addressed by the two-pointer approach, which is optimal in terms of the number of swaps.
*   The problem specifically requires an in-place solution, which rules out creating a new array.
