Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for problem 199, "Binary Tree Right Side View."

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

The input clearly defines:

*   **Problem Number:** 199

*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0199-binary-tree-right-side-view`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since no solution was provided, we'll generate Python solutions. We'll provide both a Breadth-First Search (BFS) and a Depth-First Search (DFS) solution.  Since the input includes a tree structure, we'll need to define a `TreeNode` class first.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
This `TreeNode` definition will be included at the beginning of each solution file.

        self.left = left
        self.right = right

from collections import deque

def rightSideView(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        # Iterate through the current level
        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            # For the rightmost node of each level, append its value
            if i == level_size - 1:
                result.append(node.val)

            # Add children to the queue
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

    return result
```

# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the *right side* of it, return the *values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom*.

**Example 1:**

Input: `root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]`
Output: `[1,3,4]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `root = [1,null,3]`
Output: `[1,3]`

**Example 3:**

Input: `root = []`
Output: `[]`

**Example 4:**

Input: `root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5]`
Output: `[1,2,4,5]`

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Approach(es)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

We can perform a level-order traversal (BFS) of the binary tree. For each level, we only keep track of the *rightmost* node.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty list `result` to store the right side view.
    *   Create a queue `queue` and initialize it with the `root` node.

2.  **Level-Order Traversal:**
    *   While the `queue` is not empty:
        *   Get the number of nodes at the current level (`level_size`).
        *   Iterate through the current level (from 0 to `level_size - 1`):
            *   Dequeue a node from the `queue`.
            *   If it's the last node at the current level (index `i == level_size - 1`), add its value to `result`.
            *   Enqueue the node's left child (if it exists).
            *   Enqueue the node's right child (if it exists).

3.  **Return:** Return the `result` list.

**Data Structures:**

*   Queue (using `collections.deque` in Python for efficient enqueue/dequeue operations).
*   List (`result`).

**Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.

**Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case (a complete binary tree), W can be O(N).

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

We can also use a modified DFS approach. We traverse the tree, prioritizing the right subtree over the left subtree.  We keep track of the current level, and if we reach a level that hasn't been visited yet, we add the node's value to the result.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty list `result`.
    *   Define a recursive helper function `dfs(node, level)`:

2.  **Base Case (within `dfs`):**
    *   If `node` is `None`, return.

3.  **Right Side View Logic (within `dfs`):**
    *   If `level` is equal to the current length of `result`, it means we've reached a new level, and this is the first node we've encountered at this level (and it must be the rightmost node because we prioritize the right subtree).  Append `node.val` to `result`.

4.  **Recursive Calls (within `dfs`):**
    *   Recursively call `dfs` on the right child first: `dfs(node.right, level + 1)`.
    *   Then, recursively call `dfs` on the left child: `dfs(node.left, level + 1)`.

5.  **Initial Call:** Call `dfs(root, 0)` to start the traversal.

6.  **Return:** Return the `result` list.

**Data Structures:**

*   List (`result`).

**Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  We visit each node once.

**Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be O(N). In the best case (a balanced tree), H is O(log N).  This space is due to the recursion call stack.

## Code

[BFS Approach](./solution_bfs.py)
[DFS Approach](./solution_dfs.py)

## Notes (Optional)

* Both BFS and DFS provide efficient solutions.  BFS is generally preferred for finding the shortest path or level-related problems, while DFS can be more space-efficient for balanced trees.
* The problem's constraint (tree size up to 100 nodes) means that both approaches are acceptable in terms of performance.

# Trees

Trees are a fundamental non-linear data structure in computer science that represent hierarchical relationships between elements. They are widely used in various applications, including file systems, databases, network routing, and representing hierarchical data.

## Key Concepts

*   **Node:**  The basic building block of a tree.  Each node contains a value (data) and may have links (pointers or references) to other nodes (its children).
*   **Root:** The topmost node in the tree. It is the only node that has no parent.
*   **Parent:** A node that has one or more child nodes.
*   **Child:** A node that is connected to a parent node.
*   **Leaf (External Node):** A node that has no children.
*   **Internal Node:** A node that has at least one child (i.e., not a leaf).
*   **Edge:** The connection between two nodes (parent and child).
*   **Path:** A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node to a descendant.
*   **Depth of a Node:** The length of the path from the root to that node (number of edges). The depth of the root is 0.
*   **Height of a Node:** The length of the longest path from that node to a leaf.  The height of a leaf is 0.
*   **Height of a Tree:** The height of the root node.
*   **Level:** All nodes at the same depth.
*   **Subtree:** A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.
*   **Ancestor:** A node reachable by repeatedly proceeding from child to parent.
*   **Descendant:** A node reachable by repeatedly proceeding from parent to child.

## Types of Trees

*   **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children, referred to as the *left child* and the *right child*. This is the most common type of tree used in LeetCode problems.
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree with the following properties:
    *   The value of the key in the left child (if it exists) is less than the value of the key in the parent.
    *   The value of the key in the right child (if it exists) is greater than the value of the key in the parent.
    *   The left and right subtrees are also BSTs.
*   **Complete Binary Tree:** Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
*   **Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree):** Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
*   **Perfect Binary Tree:** All internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
*   **Balanced Binary Tree:**  The heights of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most 1 (this is the definition of an AVL tree; other definitions of "balanced" exist).  Balanced trees generally provide O(log n) performance for search, insertion, and deletion.
*   **N-ary Tree (Multiway Tree):**  Each node can have up to N children.

## Tree Traversals

Tree traversals are algorithms to visit (process) each node in a tree exactly once.  The most common traversal methods are:

*   **Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right):**
    1.  Visit the root.
    2.  Traverse the left subtree in preorder.
    3.  Traverse the right subtree in preorder.

*   **Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right):**  (Most commonly used with Binary Search Trees, where it visits nodes in sorted order).
    1.  Traverse the left subtree in inorder.
    2.  Visit the root.
    3.  Traverse the right subtree in inorder.

*   **Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root):**
    1.  Traverse the left subtree in postorder.
    2.  Traverse the right subtree in postorder.
    3.  Visit the root.

*   **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Traversal):** Visit nodes level by level, from left to right. This is typically implemented using a queue.

## Representation of Trees

*   **Node Class:** The most common way to represent trees in code is to create a `Node` class (or struct) that contains the node's data and pointers to its children.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

*   **Adjacency List:**  Can be used for general trees (not just binary trees).  Each node has a list of its children.
*   **Array Representation (for Complete Binary Trees):**  A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented using an array.  The root is at index 0.  For a node at index `i`:
    *   The left child is at index `2 * i + 1`.
    *   The right child is at index `2 * i + 2`.
    *   The parent is at index `(i - 1) // 2`.

## Tips for LeetCode Tree Problems

*   **Understand Tree Traversals:**  Master the four main tree traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder, and level order).
*   **Use Recursion:**  Many tree problems can be solved elegantly using recursion, as trees have a naturally recursive structure.
*   **Base Cases:**  Carefully define the base cases for your recursive functions (usually when the node is `None`).
*   **Consider Edge Cases:**  Think about empty trees, trees with one node, skewed trees, and other edge cases.
*   **Draw Diagrams:**  Visualizing the tree and the traversal steps can be very helpful.
* **Choose Appropriate Traversal:** Decide if you need BFS or DFS (BFS for levels, shortest path and DFS otherwise).
* **Understand BST properties:** Remember BST properties when solving relative questions.

Trees are a fundamental data structure, and understanding them is essential for solving many algorithmic problems.

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that systematically explores a graph level by level.  It starts at a designated source node and visits all the node's immediate neighbors (nodes directly connected to it). Then, for each of those neighbors, it visits their unvisited neighbors, and so on.  BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.

## Key Concepts

*   **Level-Order Traversal:** BFS explores the graph in a level-by-level manner.  All nodes at a given distance from the source node are visited before moving on to nodes at the next distance level.
*   **Queue Data Structure:**  BFS uses a queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out) to maintain the order in which nodes are visited.  Nodes are added to the rear of the queue and removed from the front.
*   **Visited Set (or Array):**  To avoid visiting the same node multiple times (and to prevent cycles), BFS keeps track of the nodes that have already been visited, typically using a set or a boolean array.
*   **Shortest Path (in Unweighted Graphs):**  BFS is guaranteed to find the *shortest path* between the source node and any other reachable node in an *unweighted* graph.  This is because it explores nodes in increasing order of their distance from the source.

## How BFS Works

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a queue and enqueue the source node.
    *   Create a set (or boolean array) to track visited nodes and mark the source node as visited.

2.  **Iteration:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
    *   Process the dequeued node (e.g., print its value, check if it's the target node, etc.).
    *   For each of the node's *unvisited* neighbors:
        *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
        *   Enqueue the neighbor.

## Example (Python - Graph represented as Adjacency List)

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start_node):
    visited = set()  # Keep track of visited nodes
    queue = deque([start_node])  # Initialize the queue with the starting node
    visited.add(start_node)

    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node
        print(vertex, end=" ")  # Process the node (in this case, print it)

        # Iterate through the neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue the unvisited neighbor

# Example graph (adjacency list representation)
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

print("BFS traversal starting from node A:")
bfs(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B C D E F
```

## Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  In the worst case, we visit each node and each edge once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum *width* of the graph (the maximum number of nodes at any level). In the worst case (e.g., a complete binary tree or a very wide graph), W can be O(V).  This is because, in the worst case, the queue might hold all nodes at a particular level.

## Applications of BFS

*   **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs:**  As mentioned earlier, BFS finds the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
*   **Level Order Traversal of Trees:** BFS is used to perform a level-order traversal of a tree.
*   **Finding Connected Components:**  BFS can be used to find all the connected components in a graph.
*   **Web Crawling:**  BFS can be used to systematically explore web pages, starting from a seed URL.
*   **Network Broadcasting:**  BFS can be used to simulate broadcasting a message to all nodes in a network.
*    **Garbage Collection:** (Mark and Sweep Algorithm)

*   **Use a Queue:**  Remember to use a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.
*   **Track Visited Nodes:**  Use a set or boolean array to avoid cycles and redundant visits.
*   **Handle Edge Cases:**  Consider empty graphs, disconnected graphs, and other edge cases.
*   **Practice:**  Work through various BFS problems to build your intuition.  BFS problems often involve grids or other structures that can be implicitly treated as graphs.

BFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that is essential for solving a wide range of problems.

# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a designated source node and explores one of its neighbors, then one of *that* neighbor's neighbors, and so on, until it reaches a dead end (a node with no unvisited neighbors).  Then, it backtracks to the previous node and explores another branch. DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack.

## Key Concepts

*   **Recursive Exploration:** DFS is naturally recursive. It explores a branch completely before moving on to the next branch.
*   **Stack Data Structure (for Iterative Implementation):** The iterative version of DFS uses a stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out) to keep track of the nodes to visit. The recursive version implicitly uses the call stack.
*   **Visited Set (or Array):** Like BFS, DFS uses a set or boolean array to track visited nodes and prevent cycles.
*   **Backtracking:**  When DFS reaches a dead end, it "backtracks" to the previous node and explores another unvisited neighbor.

## How DFS Works (Recursive Approach)

1.  **Base Case:** If the current node is `None` (or has already been visited), return.

2.  **Mark as Visited:** Mark the current node as visited.

3.  **Process Node:** Process the current node (e.g., print its value, perform some calculation).

4.  **Recursive Calls:** For each *unvisited* neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.

## Example (Python - Graph represented as Adjacency List - Recursive)

```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, node, visited):
    if node in visited:
        return  # Base case: already visited

    visited.add(node)
    print(node, end=" ")  # Process the node

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

visited_set = set()
print("DFS traversal (recursive) starting from node A:")
dfs_recursive(graph, 'A', visited_set) # Output: A B D E F C
```

## How DFS Works (Iterative Approach)

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a stack and push the source node onto it.
    *   Create a set (or boolean array) to track visited nodes and mark the source node as visited.

2.  **Iteration:** While the stack is not empty:
    *   Pop a node from the top of the stack.
    *   Process the popped node.
    *   For each of the node's *unvisited* neighbors:
        *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
        *   Push the neighbor onto the stack.

## Example (Python - Graph represented as Adjacency List - Iterative)

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start_node):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start_node]
    visited.add(start_node)

    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()  # Pop a node from the stack
        print(vertex, end=" ")

        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                stack.append(neighbor)

# Example graph (same as before)
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

print("\nDFS traversal (iterative) starting from node A:")
dfs_iterative(graph, 'A') # Output: A C F E B D

```
Note: The order can be different from the recursive, due to the nature of stack (FILO)

## Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.  We visit each node and each edge once.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   **Recursive DFS:** O(H), where H is the height of the recursion tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree or a long path in a graph), H can be O(V).  This is due to the call stack.
    *   **Iterative DFS:** O(W), where W the maximum "width" the graph during the traversal. In the worst case (a skewed tree or a long path in a graph), W can be O(V). This is because in worst case, the stack might hold all nodes of a path.

## Applications of DFS

*   **Finding Connected Components:** DFS can be used to identify all connected components in a graph.
*   **Topological Sorting (for Directed Acyclic Graphs - DAGs):**  DFS can be used to find a topological ordering of a DAG, which is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering.
*   **Cycle Detection:** DFS can be used to detect cycles in a graph. If you encounter a visited node during the traversal (that isn't the immediate parent), there's a cycle.
*   **Path Finding:**  While BFS is better for finding the *shortest* path in unweighted graphs, DFS can be used to find *any* path between two nodes.
*   **Solving Mazes:** DFS can be used to find a path through a maze.
* **Binary Tree Right Side View:** [199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/) (Medium)
* **Path Sum (and variations):**  Finding paths in a tree that sum to a target value.
* **Combinatorial Problems:** Exploring all possible combinations or permutations.
* **Checking Bipartiteness:**  Determining if a graph is bipartite (can be colored with two colors such that no adjacent nodes have the same color).

*   **Reconstruct Itinerary:** [332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/) (Hard)

## Tips for LeetCode DFS Problems

*   **Recognize DFS Patterns:**  Look for problems that involve exploring all paths, finding connected components, detecting cycles, or solving combinatorial problems.
*   **Choose Recursive or Iterative:**  The recursive approach is often more concise and easier to read for DFS.  The iterative approach can be useful if you need to avoid stack overflow errors for very deep recursion.
*   **Track Visited Nodes:** Use a set or boolean array to avoid cycles and prevent revisiting nodes.
*   **Handle Base Cases:**  Carefully define the base cases for your recursive functions.
*   **Backtracking:**  Understand how backtracking works in DFS.  When you reach a dead end, you implicitly backtrack by returning from the recursive call (or by not pushing any more nodes onto the stack in the iterative version).

DFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that is crucial for solving many algorithmic problems, particularly those involving trees, graphs, and combinatorial search.
