## Problem Description

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3]`, `[1,3,2]`, `[2, 1, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, `[3,1,2]`, `[3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the *next permutation* of `nums`.

The replacement must be **in place** and use only **constant extra memory**.

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`
Output: `[1,3,2]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [3,2,1]`
Output: `[1,2,3]`

**Example 3:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,5]`
Output: `[1,5,1]`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Approach(es)

### In-Place Algorithm

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Find the First Decreasing Element:** Starting from the right, find the first element `nums[i]` that is smaller than its immediate right neighbor `nums[i+1]`.  This means the subarray from `i+1` to the end is in descending order.
2.  **Handle Entirely Decreasing Array:** If no such element is found (i.e., `i < 0`), the entire array is in descending order.  In this case, the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation (sorted in ascending order), so we simply reverse the entire array and return.
3.  **Find the Swap Element:** If `i >= 0`, find the smallest element `nums[j]` in the subarray `nums[i+1:]` that is greater than `nums[i]`.  Since the subarray `nums[i+1:]` is in descending order, we can find `nums[j]` by iterating from the right.
4.  **Swap:** Swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
5.  **Reverse the Subarray:** Reverse the subarray `nums[i+1:]` to get the smallest possible arrangement of the elements to the right of `i`. This ensures we find the *next* permutation.

**Data Structures:**

*   No extra data structures are used beyond a few integer variables for indices.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We perform at most three linear scans: finding `i`, finding `j`, and reversing the subarray.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) - Constant extra space. We perform the operations in place.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This algorithm is efficient in both time and space, achieving the required in-place modification with constant extra memory. It is the standard and optimal approach for this problem.

# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures storing collections of elements of the *same data type*, accessed by index.

**Key Properties:**

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements stored contiguously.
*   **Fixed Size (Often):** Array size often fixed at compile time. Dynamic arrays resize, with a performance cost.
*   **Zero-Based Indexing (Usually):** First element at index 0.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:** Elements usually of same type.

**Common Operations (Time):**

*   **Access:** O(1)
*   **Insertion (end, dynamic):** Amortized O(1)
*   **Insertion (specific):** O(n)
*   **Deletion (specific):** O(n)
*   **Search (unsorted):** O(n)
*   **Search (sorted):** O(log n)

**Python Lists:** Dynamic arrays.

# Permutations

A permutation of a set of elements is an arrangement of those elements into a specific order.  The number of permutations of a set of `n` distinct elements is `n!` (n factorial), which is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1`.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Order Matters:**  The order of elements is significant in a permutation. `[1, 2, 3]` is a different permutation from `[3, 2, 1]`.
*   **Distinct Elements (Usually):**  Permutation problems often involve distinct elements. If there are duplicate elements, the number of *distinct* permutations is less than `n!`.
*   **Lexicographical Order:** Permutations can be ordered lexicographically, similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary.

**Generating Permutations:**

*   **Recursive Backtracking:**  A common way to generate all permutations is to use recursive backtracking.  At each step, you choose an element to place in the current position and recursively generate permutations for the remaining elements.
*   **Iterative Approaches:**  There are also iterative algorithms for generating permutations, such as the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm (also known as the plain changes algorithm) and Heap's algorithm.
*   **Next Permutation:**  Finding the *next* permutation in lexicographical order can be done efficiently without generating all permutations (as in LeetCode problem 31).

**Example (n=3, elements: {1, 2, 3}):**

The 3! = 6 permutations are:

1.  `[1, 2, 3]`
2.  `[1, 3, 2]`
3.  `[2, 1, 3]`
4.  `[2, 3, 1]`
5.  `[3, 1, 2]`
6.  `[3, 2, 1]`
