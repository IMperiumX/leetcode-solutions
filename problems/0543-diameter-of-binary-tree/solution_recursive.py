543. Diameter of Binary Tree - Recursive Approach

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
