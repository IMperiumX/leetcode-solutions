## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

**Example 3:**

Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach(es)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Direction Flag
- **Algorithm:**
  - Use a queue for level-order traversal (BFS).
  - Use a boolean flag (`left_to_right`) to keep track of the traversal direction for each level.
  - Initialize the flag to `True` (left-to-right for the first level).
  - While the queue is not empty:
    - Get the number of nodes at the current level.
    - Create an empty list (`current_level`) to store the nodes of the current level.
    - Process each node at the current level:
        - Dequeue a node.
        - Append the node's value to current_level list.
        - Enqueue the node's children (left and right, if they exist).
    - If the `left_to_right` flag is `False`, reverse the `current_level` list.
    - Append `current_level` to the `result` list.
    - Toggle the `left_to_right` flag for the next level.
  - Return the `result` list.
 - **Data Structures:**
    - Queue (using `collections.deque` in Python for efficiency).
 - **Time Complexity:**
  - O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree.  In the worst case (a complete binary tree), w can be proportional to n (specifically, up to n/2).  On average, it's less than n.

 - **Trade-offs:**

    - BFS is a natural fit for level-order traversals. The addition of the direction flag makes it suitable for zigzag traversal.

## Code

[BFS Approach](./solution_bfs.py)

## Notes (Optional)
- A Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is *possible* but would be significantly more complex to implement for zigzag traversal. BFS is much more intuitive and efficient for this problem.
- Using a deque (double-ended queue) provides efficient enqueue and dequeue operations. Using a regular list and inserting/removing at the beginning for the right-to-left levels would be O(n) for those operations, leading to overall worse performance.
```

*   **Step 5: Topic Extraction**

Since this problem uses Binary Trees and BFS, we'll create separate files for each, if not exist already. Since the prompt to create `Binary Tree.md` was issued previously, then we should only create the `BFS.md`

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that systematically explores a graph or tree level by level.  It starts at a given node (the root in a tree, or a source node in a graph) and visits all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors.

## Key Concepts

*   **Queue:** BFS uses a queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out) data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit.
*   **Visited Set (or Array):**  In graphs (which can have cycles), a "visited" set (or array) is crucial to prevent revisiting nodes and avoid infinite loops. In trees (which are acyclic), the visited set is often not explicitly needed, as the tree structure itself prevents cycles.
*   **Level-Order Traversal:**  BFS performs a level-order traversal of a tree, meaning it visits nodes in order of their distance from the root.
*   **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** In an unweighted graph, BFS can be used to find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) between a source node and any other reachable node.

## Algorithm (for Trees)

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty queue.
    *   Enqueue the root node.
2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
        *   Process the node (e.g., print its value, check a condition).
        *   Enqueue all of the node's *unvisited* children (in a tree, this means its left and right children, if they exist).

## Algorithm (for Graphs)

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty queue.
    *   Create an empty "visited" set (or array).
    *   Enqueue the starting node.
    *   Mark the starting node as visited.
2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
        *   Process the node.
        *   For each of the node's neighbors:
            *   If the neighbor has *not* been visited:
                *   Enqueue the neighbor.
                *   Mark the neighbor as visited.

## Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  In a tree, E = V - 1, so the time complexity is O(V) (or O(n), where n is the number of nodes).  Each node and edge is visited at most once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree/graph (the maximum number of nodes at any level). In the worst case (e.g., a complete binary tree or a fully connected graph), W can be proportional to V, so the space complexity can be O(V) in the worst case. On average, and especially for sparse graphs/trees, the space complexity is often much less than O(V).

## Advantages of BFS

*   **Finds Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):**  BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
*   **Level-Order Traversal:**  Naturally explores a tree or graph level by level.
*   **Completeness:**  BFS is guaranteed to find a path to a target node if one exists (assuming the graph is finite).

## Disadvantages of BFS

*   **Memory Usage:**  Can require significant memory, especially for wide graphs/trees, as it needs to store all nodes at a given level in the queue.
*   **Not Suitable for Weighted Graphs:**  For finding shortest paths in *weighted* graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm is used instead of BFS.

## Use Cases

*   **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** Finding the shortest path between two nodes.
*   **Level-Order Traversal of Trees:** Processing nodes level by level.
*   **Web Crawling:**  Crawling websites by following links (each link is an edge, each webpage is a node).
*   **Network Broadcasting:**  Sending a message to all nodes in a network.
*   **Social Networks:**  Finding connections between people.
*   **Garbage Collection:**  Some garbage collection algorithms use BFS to identify reachable objects.
*   **Game AI:** Pathfinding in games (e.g., finding the shortest path for a character to move).
