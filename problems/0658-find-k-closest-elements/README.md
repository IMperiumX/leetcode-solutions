# 658. Find K Closest Elements, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:

|a - x| < |b - x|, or
|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b

**Example 1:**

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

Input: arr = [1,1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
Output: [1,1,2,3]

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= k <= arr.length
*   1 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   arr is sorted in ascending order.
*   -10<sup>4</sup> <= arr[i], x <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Approach(es)

### Binary Search Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `len(arr) - k`.  These pointers define the possible starting positions of the resulting subarray of size `k`.
2.  Perform binary search:
    *   Calculate `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
    *   Compare the distance between `x` and `arr[mid]` with the distance between `x` and `arr[mid + k]`.
        *   If `x - arr[mid] > arr[mid + k] - x`, it means the window should shift to the right, so set `left = mid + 1`.
        *   Otherwise, the window should stay or shift to the left, so set `right = mid`.
3.  After the binary search, `left` points to the starting index of the `k` closest elements.
4.  Return `arr[left:left + k]`.

Data Structures:

*   Array: The input is a sorted array.

Time Complexity:

*   O(log(n - k)), where n is the length of `arr`. The binary search takes logarithmic time.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), as we use only constant extra space.

Trade-offs:
- Very efficient in finding the window's starting point.
- Relies on the array being sorted.

### Two Pointers Approach (after Binary Search)
Algorithm:
1. Find the correct position to insert the number x in the array by using bisect_left buildin function
2. Initialize two pointers around the insertion point
3. Expand window untill it reach k size, and then, shift according to the problem description
4. Return the array within left and right pointers

Data Structures:
    * Array: The input is a sorted array.

Time Complexity:

*   O(log N + K), where N is the length of `arr`.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), as we use only constant extra space.

Trade-offs:
- We can use this approach if bisect function not allowed

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Explanations**

*   **Binary Search:** This problem is a classic application of binary search to find a specific range within a sorted array.
*   **Two Pointers:** Two pointers approach is efficient.

# Binary Search

## Explanation

Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a **sorted** array (or list). It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  If the middle element is the target, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the interval is empty.

**Algorithm (Iterative):**

1.  Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `len(array) - 1`.
2.  While `left <= right`:
    *   Calculate `mid = (left + right) // 2`  (integer division).
    *   If `array[mid] == target`, return `mid`.
    *   If `target < array[mid]`, set `right = mid - 1`.
    *   If `target > array[mid]`, set `left = mid + 1`.
3.  If the loop finishes without finding the target, return -1 (or some other indicator that the target is not present).

**Algorithm (Recursive):**

```python
def binary_search_recursive(array, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  # Target not found

    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if array[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif target < array[mid]:
        return binary_search_recursive(array, target, left, mid - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search_recursive(array, target, mid + 1, right)
```
**Time Complexity:**

*   O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each comparison eliminates half of the remaining elements.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) for the iterative version (constant extra space).
*   O(log n) for the recursive version in the worst case (due to the call stack), though tail-call optimization can sometimes reduce this to O(1).

**Advantages:**

*   Extremely efficient for searching sorted data.
*   Simple to implement (especially the iterative version).

**Disadvantages:**

*   Requires the input data to be sorted.
*   Not suitable for unsorted data.

# Two Pointers

## Explanation
The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (indices or references) that move through the data structure, often from opposite ends or in the same direction, to efficiently find a solution. This approach can significantly reduce time complexity compared to brute-force methods.

**Common Patterns:**

1.  **Opposite Ends:** Two pointers start at the beginning and end of the array and move towards each other.  This is often used for problems involving sorted arrays or palindromes.
2.  **Same Direction (Sliding Window):** Two pointers start at the beginning of the array and move in the same direction.  The "window" between the pointers represents a sub-array or sub-string that is being considered.  This is useful for finding sub-arrays/sub-strings that meet certain criteria.
3.  **Fast and Slow Pointers:**  Two pointers move at different speeds. This is commonly used in linked list problems to detect cycles or find the middle node.
4.  **Multiple Arrays/Strings:** Two (or more) pointers are used to traverse multiple arrays or strings simultaneously.

**Advantages:**

*   **Efficiency:**  Often reduces time complexity to O(n) or O(n log n), where n is the size of the input.
*   **Space Efficiency:**  Typically requires only O(1) extra space (for the pointers).
*   **Versatility:**  Applicable to a wide range of problems.

**Disadvantages:**

*   May require careful handling of edge cases and pointer movement.
*   Not always the most intuitive approach for all problems.

**Example Scenarios and Algorithms:**

*   **Two Sum (Sorted Array):** Given a sorted array and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target. (Opposite Ends)
*   **Valid Palindrome:** Determine if a string is a palindrome. (Opposite Ends)
*   **Subarray Sum Equals K:** Find a contiguous sub-array that sums to a given value. (Sliding Window)
*   **Linked List Cycle Detection:** Determine if a linked list has a cycle. (Fast and Slow Pointers)
*   **Merge Sorted Arrays:** Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. (Multiple Arrays)
*   **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:** Remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place. (Same Direction)
*   **3Sum:** Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero. (Combination of sorting and two-pointer techniques).
*   **Container With Most Water:** Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water. (Opposite Ends).
