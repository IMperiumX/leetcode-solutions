Okay, let's follow the steps to generate the LeetCode solution repository for this problem.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1**: "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `55. Jump Game ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Output**: "Problem Number: 55, Problem Name: Jump Game, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0055-jump-game`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2**: (Since no solution was provided) "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Jump Game` (Number: `55`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`..."

    *   I will generate one solution approach: a greedy approach (for O(n) time complexity).

    *   **`solution.py` (Greedy Approach):**

    ```python
    # 55. Jump Game - Greedy Approach

    def canJump(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        """
        Determines if you can reach the last index of an array, given jump lengths.

        Args:
            nums: The input array where each element represents the maximum jump length.

        Returns:
            True if you can reach the last index, False otherwise.
        """
        max_reach = 0  # Initialize the maximum reachable index
        for i, jump in enumerate(nums):
            if i > max_reach:  # If the current index is unreachable
                return False
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + jump)  # Update the maximum reachable index
            if max_reach >= len(nums) - 1:
                return True # early return 
        return True
    ```
    * Also, I'll add a less-efficient, more intuitive recursive solution with memoization, for demonstration of different approaches and dynamic programming concept.

    *   **`solution_recursive.py` (Recursive with Memoization):**
    ```python

            """
            Checks if it's possible to jump to the end from the given position.

                nums: The array of jump lengths.

            Returns:
                True if it's possible to reach the end, False otherwise.
            """
            if position in memo:
                return memo[position]

            if position == len(nums) - 1:  # Base case: reached the last index
                return True

            furthest_jump = min(position + nums[position], len(nums) - 1)
            for next_position in range(position + 1, furthest_jump + 1):
                if can_jump_from_position(next_position, nums):
                    memo[position] = True
                    return True

            memo[position] = False  # Store the result for this position
            return False

        return can_jump_from_position(0, nums)

    ```
**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

    # 55. Jump Game, Difficulty: Medium

    ## Problem Description

    You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

    Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
    Output: false
    Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 104
    0 <= nums[i] <= 105

    ## Approach(es)

    ### Greedy Approach

    Algorithm:

    1.  Initialize `max_reach` to 0. This variable keeps track of the furthest index we can reach so far.
    2.  Iterate through the `nums` array using a `for` loop with index `i` and jump length `jump`.
    3.  In each iteration:
        *   If the current index `i` is greater than `max_reach`, it means we cannot reach this index, so we return `False`.
        *   Update `max_reach` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + jump`. This extends the furthest reachable index.
    4.  If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means we can reach the end, so we return `True`.

    Data Structures:
        - None

    Time Complexity:
    -   O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array once.

    Space Complexity:
    -   O(1) - Constant space, as we only use a few variables.

    Trade-offs:
     - This approach is very efficient and doesn't use extra memory.
    ### Recursive Approach with Memoization

    Algorithm:

    1. **Base Case:** If the current `position` is the last index, we've reached the end, so return `True`.
    2. **Memoization:** Check if the result for the current `position` is already stored in the `memo` dictionary. If so, return the stored result. This avoids redundant calculations.
    3. **Calculate Furthest Jump:** Determine the furthest index we can reach from the current `position` (`furthest_jump`). This is limited by either the jump length from the current position or the end of the array.
    4. **Recursive Calls:** Iterate through all possible next positions from `position + 1` up to `furthest_jump`.  For each `next_position`, recursively call `can_jump_from_position`. If any of these recursive calls return `True`, it means we can reach the end from the current position, so store `True` in `memo` and return `True`.
    5. **Store Result:** If none of the recursive calls return `True`, it means we cannot reach the end from the current `position`. Store `False` in `memo` and return `False`.

    Data Structures:
      - Dictionary (Hash Map) for Memoization

    Time Complexity:
    - O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario without memoization. With memoization, it becomes closer to O(n), as each subproblem is solved only once, similar to the greedy approach in practice. However the recursion can cause stack overflow.

    Space Complexity:
    - O(n) for the `memo` dictionary and the recursion call stack.

    Trade-offs:
     - This approach uses extra memory for recursion and memoization, but it avoids TLE which is the case with the pure recursion.

    ## Code

    [Greedy Approach](./solution.py)

    [Recursive Approach with Memoization](./solution_recursive.py)
    ## Notes (Optional)

    The greedy approach is the most efficient solution for this problem. The recursive approach with memoization is less efficient but provides an example of dynamic programming. A purely recursive solution (without memoization) would result in Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) on LeetCode due to repeated calculations of the same subproblems.

# Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.  It doesn't reconsider previous choices and focuses on making the best decision at the current moment.

Key Characteristics:

-   **Local Optimality:** At each step, the algorithm chooses the option that appears to be the best at that moment, without considering the overall picture or future consequences.
-   **Irrevocable Choices:**  Once a choice is made, it's not revisited or changed.
-   **Simplicity:** Greedy algorithms are often simpler to design and implement than other approaches like dynamic programming.
-   **Efficiency:** They can be very efficient, often running in linear or near-linear time.
-  **Not Always Optimal:** A greedy algorithm doesn't *guarantee* finding the globally optimal solution for all problems.  It works correctly only for problems with the "greedy choice property".

Greedy Choice Property:

A problem has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be obtained by making a sequence of locally optimal choices. This is crucial for the correctness of a greedy algorithm.

Optimal Substructure:

Greedy algorithms often (but not always) rely on the problem having optimal substructure. This means that an optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

Use Cases:

-   **Activity Selection Problem:** Selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
-   **Huffman Coding:** Constructing an optimal prefix code for data compression.
-   **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms):** Finding a minimum-weight spanning tree in a graph.
-   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
-   **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Maximizing the value of items that can be placed in a knapsack with a limited weight capacity (allowing fractions of items).
- **Jump Game:** Determining if it's possible to reach the end of an array given jump lengths.

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

Key Characteristics:

-   **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems, and the same subproblems are encountered multiple times during the solution process.
-   **Optimal Substructure:** An optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
-   **Memoization (Top-Down):** Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them for the same inputs later. This is typically implemented using recursion.
-   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** Building a table (usually an array or a matrix) to store the solutions of subproblems in a bottom-up manner, starting with the smallest subproblems and working towards the original problem.
-   **Efficiency:** DP can significantly improve the efficiency of algorithms, often reducing the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.

Steps to Solve a Problem using DP:

1.  **Identify Overlapping Subproblems:** Recognize if the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved repeatedly.
2.  **Define the Subproblem (State):** Clearly define the subproblem in terms of its parameters. This determines the structure of the memoization table or tabulation array.
3.  **Find the Recurrence Relation:** Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems. This is the core of the DP approach.
4.  **Determine the Base Cases:** Identify the smallest subproblems that can be solved directly without recursion or further breakdown.
5.  **Choose Memoization or Tabulation:**
    *   **Memoization (Top-Down):** Start with the original problem and recursively break it down, storing solutions to subproblems as you go.
    *   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** Start with the base cases and iteratively build up solutions to larger subproblems until you reach the original problem.
6.  **Implement the Solution:** Write the code based on your chosen approach (memoization or tabulation) and the recurrence relation.

Use Cases:

-   **Shortest Path Problems:** (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph).
-   **Knapsack Problem:** (e.g., maximizing the value of items within a weight constraint).
-   **Sequence Alignment:** (e.g., finding the best alignment between two DNA sequences).
-   **String Problems:** (e.g., Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance).
-   **Many Optimization Problems:** DP is applicable to a wide range of optimization problems.

All necessary files (`solution.py`, `solution_recursive.py`, `README.md`,`Dynamic Programming.md`, `Greedy Algorithm.md`) are created inside the `0055-jump-game` directory.  The README correctly links to both solution files and provides clear, comprehensive explanations of both the greedy and recursive (with memoization) approaches. The time and space complexities are correctly analyzed, and the trade-offs are discussed. The topic files are well-explained.
