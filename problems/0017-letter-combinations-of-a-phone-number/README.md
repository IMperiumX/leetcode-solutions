Okay, let's generate the files and content for LeetCode problem 17, "Letter Combinations of a Phone Number."

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem... `17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number ...`."

*   **Output:** `Problem Number: 17, Problem Name: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number, Difficulty: Medium`

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0017-letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2:** (No solution provided) "Generate solutions... `Letter Combinations of a Phone Number` (Number: `17`). ... `solution.py` ... separate solution files..."

We will create `solution_backtracking.py` (backtracking/recursive approach) which is the most common approach.

*   `solution_backtracking.py`:

```python
# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number - Backtracking Approach

def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Generates all possible letter combinations that a phone number could represent.

    Args:
        digits: A string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive.

    Returns:
        A list of all possible letter combinations.
    """
    if not digits:
        return []

    digit_to_letters = {
        "2": "abc",
        "3": "def",
        "4": "ghi",
        "5": "jkl",
        "6": "mno",
        "7": "pqrs",
        "8": "tuv",
        "9": "wxyz",
    }

    result = []

    def backtrack(index: int, current_combination: str):
        if index == len(digits):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return

        digit = digits[index]
        letters = digit_to_letters[digit]
        for letter in letters:
            backtrack(index + 1, current_combination + letter)

    backtrack(0, "")
    return result

```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file ... for `Letter Combinations of a Phone Number` (Number: `17`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

```markdown
# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:

Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Constraints:

0 <= digits.length <= 4
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

## Approach(es)

### Backtracking Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Base Case:** If the input `digits` string is empty, return an empty list.
2.  **Mapping:** Create a dictionary `digit_to_letters` that maps each digit (as a string) to its corresponding letters.
3.  **Result List:** Initialize an empty list `result` to store the combinations.
4.  **Recursive Helper Function `backtrack(index, current_combination)`:**
    *   **Base Case:** If `index` is equal to the length of `digits`, it means we've processed all digits. Add `current_combination` to `result` and return.
    *   **Get Letters:** Get the current digit `digit` from `digits` at `index`.  Get the corresponding letters `letters` from `digit_to_letters`.
    *   **Iterate through Letters:** For each `letter` in `letters`:
        *   Recursively call `backtrack(index + 1, current_combination + letter)`. This appends the current `letter` to the `current_combination` and moves to the next digit.
5.  **Initial Call:** Call `backtrack(0, "")` to start the backtracking process with an initial index of 0 and an empty combination string.
6.  **Return:** Return the `result` list.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (for digit-to-letter mapping).
*   List (to store the results).
*   String (for the current combination).

Time Complexity:

*   O(4^n), where n is the length of the `digits` string. In the worst case (digits are all 7s or 9s), each digit has 4 possible letters.  So, there can be up to 4\*4\*...\*4 (n times) = 4^n combinations.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) for the recursion depth (call stack), and O(4^n) to store the resulting combinations, which dominates.

Trade-offs:
* Backtracking is very efficient to find all possible solutions.
