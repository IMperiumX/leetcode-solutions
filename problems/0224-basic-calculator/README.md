Okay, let's create the solution, README, and topic files for LeetCode problem 224: "Basic Calculator". This is a classic problem that tests your understanding of stacks and expression parsing.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 224
*   **Problem Name:** Basic Calculator
*   **Difficulty:** Hard

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

I'll create a folder named `0224-basic-calculator`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

The most common and robust approach is to use a stack.  Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Iterate:** Go through the input string `s` character by character.
2.  **Digits:** If we encounter a digit, build the complete number (it might be multi-digit).
3.  **Operators (+, -):**  Keep track of the current sign (+1 or -1).  Add the current number (multiplied by the current sign) to the running result.  Reset the current number to 0 and update the sign.
4.  **Opening Parenthesis (`(`):**  Push the current result and sign onto the stack.  Reset the result to 0 and the sign to +1.  This effectively saves the state of the calculation *before* entering the parenthesized expression.
5.  **Closing Parenthesis (`)`):** Pop the sign and previous result from the stack. Multiply the current result by the popped sign and add the popped previous result.  This combines the result of the parenthesized expression with the result from before the parenthesis.
6.  **Spaces:** Ignore spaces.

            sign = 1    # Reset sign for the sub-expression

            result += sign * num  # Calculate the result of the last number
            num = 0
            result *= stack.pop()  # Apply the sign from before the parenthesis
            result += stack.pop()  # Add the result from before the parenthesis
        # Ignore spaces

    return result + sign * num  # Add any remaining number

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

**Note:** You are *not* allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
-   `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
-   `s` represents a valid expression.
-   `'+'` is not used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1"` and `"+(2 + 3)"` is invalid).
-   `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1"` and `"-(2 + 3)"` is valid).
-   There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
-   Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

## Approach(es)

### Stack-Based Evaluation

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    -   `result = 0`:  Stores the overall result.
    -   `num = 0`:  Stores the current number being built.
    -   `sign = 1`:  Stores the current sign (+1 for positive, -1 for negative).
    -   `stack = []`:  The stack to handle parentheses.

2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the characters of the string `s`:
    -   **Digit:** If the character is a digit, update `num` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the digit's value.
    -   **'+':**  Add the current `num` (multiplied by `sign`) to `result`. Reset `num` to 0 and set `sign` to 1.
    -   **'-':** Add the current `num` (multiplied by `sign`) to `result`. Reset `num` to 0 and set `sign` to -1.
    -   **'(':**
        -   Push the current `result` onto the stack.
        -   Push the current `sign` onto the stack.
        -   Reset `result` to 0 (start a new calculation within the parentheses).
        -   Reset `sign` to 1.
    -   **')':**
        -   Add the current `num` (multiplied by `sign`) to `result`.
        -   Reset `num` to 0.
        -   Pop the *sign* from the stack and multiply `result` by it.
        -   Pop the *previous result* from the stack and add it to `result`.
    -   **' ' (Space):** Ignore spaces.

3.  **Final Calculation:** After the loop, add any remaining `num` (multiplied by `sign`) to `result`.

4.  **Return:** Return the final `result`.

**Data Structures:**

-   Stack (`stack`)

**Time Complexity:**

-   O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once.

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(n) in the worst case, due to the stack.  The stack's depth can be proportional to the nesting level of parentheses, which can be up to n/2 in the worst case (e.g., "((((...))))").

**Trade-offs:**

-   Handles parentheses correctly by using the stack to store intermediate results and signs.
-   Iterative solution, which is generally efficient.
- The stack is essential for correctly evaluating nested expressions.

## Notes

- This problem is a good exercise in parsing and evaluating expressions.
- The use of a stack is crucial for handling nested parentheses.
- The `sign` variable is used to handle both positive and negative numbers, including unary minus.
- The logic for handling parentheses involves saving the state (result and sign) before entering a subexpression and restoring it (and combining results) when exiting the subexpression.
- It's important to handle the final number after the loop, as there might be a number remaining without a following operator.
