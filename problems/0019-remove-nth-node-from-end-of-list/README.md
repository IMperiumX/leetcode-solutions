# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the n<sup>th</sup> node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**

Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2`
Output: `[1,2,3,5]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `head = [1], n = 1`
Output: `[]`

**Example 3:**

Input: `head = [1,2], n = 1`
Output: `[1]`

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
*   `1 <= sz <= 30`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `1 <= n <= sz`

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?

## Approach(es)

### Two-Pass Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Calculate Length:** Traverse the linked list to determine its length.
2.  **Find Node to Remove:** Calculate the index of the node to remove from the *beginning* of the list (which is `length - n`).
3.  **Handle Head Removal:** If `length - n` is 0, it means we need to remove the head. Return `head.next`.
4.  **Traverse and Remove:** Traverse the list again until you reach the node *before* the one to be removed. Update its `next` pointer to skip the node to be removed.

**Data Structures:**

*   Linked List Node (with `val` and `next` attributes)

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.  We traverse the list twice in the worst case.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) - Constant extra space.

**Trade-offs:**

*   Simple to understand and implement.
*   Requires two passes through the linked list.

### One-Pass (Two-Pointer) Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Dummy Node:** Create a dummy node and point its `next` to the head of the list. This simplifies handling the edge case of removing the head of the list.
2.  **Two Pointers:** Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both pointing to the dummy node.
3.  **Advance Fast Pointer:** Advance the `fast` pointer `n + 1` steps ahead.
4.  **Simultaneous Traversal:** Move both `fast` and `slow` pointers one step at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the list (becomes `None`).
5.  **Remove Node:** When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be pointing to the node *before* the one to be removed. Update `slow.next` to skip the node to be removed.
6.  **Return Head:** Return `dummy.next` (which is the head of the modified list, even if the original head was removed).

**Data Structures:**

*   Linked List Node
*  Dummy Node.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n) - We traverse the list only once.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) - Constant extra space.

**Trade-offs:**

*   More efficient than the two-pass approach, as it requires only one pass.
*   Slightly more complex to implement due to the use of two pointers and the dummy node.  The dummy node is crucial for simplifying edge-case handling.

# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory locations.  Each node contains data and a pointer (reference) to the next node in the sequence.

**Key Properties:**

*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as needed.
*   **Non-Contiguous Memory:** Nodes can be scattered throughout memory.
*   **Efficient Insertion and Deletion (at known position):**  Inserting or deleting a node only requires updating pointers, which is typically O(1) if you already have a reference to the relevant nodes.
*   **Sequential Access:**  Accessing an element at a specific index requires traversing the list from the head, which takes O(n) time.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Singly Linked List:** Each node has a pointer to the *next* node only.
    *   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has pointers to both the *next* and *previous* nodes.
    *   **Circular Linked List:** The last node's pointer points back to the head (or another node in the list), forming a cycle.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Insertion (at head, tail, or specific position):**  O(1) if you have a pointer to the insertion point; otherwise, O(n) to find the position.
*   **Deletion (at head, tail, or specific position):** O(1) if you have a pointer to the node to delete; otherwise, O(n) to find the node.
*   **Search:** O(n) - Requires traversing the list.
*   **Traversal:** O(n) - Visiting each node in the list.

**Python Implementation (Singly Linked List Node):**

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common algorithmic approach used with arrays and linked lists, often reducing time complexity.  It involves using two pointers (indices or references) that traverse the data structure.

**Common Patterns:**

1.  **Opposite Direction:** Pointers start at opposite ends and move toward each other (often used in sorted arrays or for searching pairs).
2.  **Same Direction:** Pointers start at the same position and move in the same direction (often used for finding subarrays, linked list cycles, or sliding windows).
3.  **Fast and Slow Pointers:** A special case of the same-direction pattern where one pointer moves faster than the other (very useful for linked list problems).

**Example (Fast and Slow - 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List):**

In LeetCode problem 19, we use a fast and slow pointer to find the node *before* the one to be removed. The fast pointer is advanced `n+1` steps ahead initially.  Then, both pointers move until the fast pointer reaches the end. The slow pointer will then be at the correct position for removal.  Using a *dummy* node before the head simplifies handling the edge case where the head needs to be removed.
