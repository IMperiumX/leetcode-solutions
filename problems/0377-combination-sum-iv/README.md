# 377. Combination Sum IV, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
All the elements of nums are unique.
1 <= target <= 1000

Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

## Approach(es)

### Top-Down Dynamic Programming (Memoization)

- **Algorithm:**
    - Use a recursive helper function `dp(current_sum)` that calculates the number of combinations that sum to `target` starting from `current_sum`.
    - Base Cases:
        - If `current_sum == target`, return 1 (found a valid combination).
        - If `current_sum > target`, return 0 (exceeded the target).
    - Memoization: Use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems (`memo[current_sum]`).  If the result for `current_sum` is already in `memo`, return it directly.
    - Recursive Step: For each number `num` in `nums`, recursively call `dp(current_sum + num)` and add the result to the count.
    - Store the calculated count in `memo[current_sum]` before returning.
    - Call the `dp` function initially with `current_sum = 0`.
 - **Data Structures:**
    - Dictionary (`memo`) for memoization.
 - **Time Complexity:**
    - O(n * target), where n is the length of `nums` and target is the target value.  We explore each possible sum up to the target, and for each sum, we iterate through the `nums` array. The memoization ensures that we don't recompute the same subproblems.
 - **Space Complexity:**
 - O(target). The size of the `memo` dictionary can grow up to the target value, and the recursion depth can also be up to the target value in the worst case.

### Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

- **Algorithm:**
    - Create a DP array `dp` of size `target + 1`.  `dp[i]` will store the number of combinations that sum to `i`.
    - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` (there's one way to achieve a sum of 0: the empty combination).
    - Iterate from `i = 1` to `target`:
        - For each number `num` in `nums`:
            - If `i - num >= 0`, it means we can use `num` to form a combination that sums to `i`.  Add `dp[i - num]` (the number of combinations that sum to `i - num`) to `dp[i]`.
    - Return `dp[target]`.
 - **Data Structures:**
    - Array (`dp`)
 - **Time Complexity:**
 - O(n * target).  We have nested loops: the outer loop iterates up to `target`, and the inner loop iterates through `nums`.

 - **Space Complexity:**

   - O(target).  We use a DP array of size `target + 1`.
- **Trade-offs:**
    - Both the top-down and bottom-up DP approaches have similar time and space complexities. The bottom-up approach often has slightly better performance in practice due to the absence of recursive function call overhead. The top-down approach can be more intuitive to understand.

[Bottom-Up DP](./solution_dp_bottomup.py)

## Notes (Optional)

- The key idea is to use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.  We either store results of subproblems (memoization) or build up solutions iteratively (bottom-up).
- **Follow-up: Negative Numbers:**
    - If negative numbers are allowed, the problem changes significantly. Without any limitations, you could have an infinite number of combinations. For example, if you have `nums = [-1, 1]` and `target = 1`, you could have:
        - `1`
        - `1 + 1 - 1`
        - `1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1`
        - ...and so on.
    - **Limitations:** To make the problem well-defined with negative numbers, you would need to add a limitation, such as:
        1.  **Limit the number of times each number can be used:**  For example, each number can be used at most once, or at most k times.
        2.  **Limit the total number of elements in a combination:** For example, find combinations with exactly k elements.
        3. **Limit the range of the sum.**

        Without any such limitations, the answer can become infinite.  The DP approach would also need to be modified to handle the new constraints.  For instance, with a limit on the number of elements, you'd need to add another dimension to your DP table/memoization.

- Step 5: Topic Extraction
The problem belongs to Dynamic Programming, so `Dynamic Programming.md` file should be created.

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. It's particularly useful for problems where a recursive approach would lead to exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations of the same subproblems.

## Key Concepts

*   **Optimal Substructure:** A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
*   **Overlapping Subproblems:** A problem has overlapping subproblems if the same subproblems are encountered multiple times during a recursive solution. This is where DP shines by storing the solutions to these subproblems.
*   **Memoization (Top-Down):**  A top-down approach where you start with the original problem and recursively break it down into subproblems.  You store the results of subproblems in a table (usually a dictionary or array) to avoid recomputing them.  This is essentially recursion + caching.
*   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** A bottom-up approach where you start by solving the smallest subproblems and build up to the solution of the original problem.  You typically use an iterative approach (loops) and a table (array) to store the results of subproblems.
*   **State:**  The set of parameters that uniquely define a subproblem.  For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, the state is simply the index `n`. In other problems, the state might involve multiple variables.
*   **Transition Function (Recurrence Relation):**  The equation that defines how to compute the solution to a subproblem based on the solutions to smaller subproblems.

## Steps to Solve a DP Problem

1.  **Identify Optimal Substructure:** Determine if the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2.  **Define the State:**  Clearly define the parameters that represent a subproblem.
3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation (Transition Function):**  Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of the solutions to smaller subproblems.
4.  **Choose Memoization (Top-Down) or Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**
    *   **Memoization:**  Start with a recursive function and add a memo (dictionary or array) to store results.
    *   **Tabulation:**  Create a table (usually an array) and iteratively fill it in, starting with the base cases.
5.  **Determine Base Cases:**  Identify the smallest subproblems that can be solved directly without further recursion or iteration.
6.  **Determine the Order of Computation (for Tabulation):**  In the bottom-up approach, make sure you solve subproblems in an order that ensures the solutions to smaller subproblems are available when needed.
7. **Implement and Optimize**: Code your solution.

## Advantages of Dynamic Programming

*   **Efficiency:**  Avoids redundant computations, often reducing time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
*   **Optimality:**  Guaranteed to find the optimal solution for problems with optimal substructure.

## Disadvantages of Dynamic Programming

*   **Memory Usage:**  Can require significant memory to store the solutions to subproblems (the memoization table or DP table).
*   **Complexity:**  Can be more complex to design and implement than simpler approaches like greedy algorithms (if a greedy approach works).
*   **Not Always Applicable:** Not all optimization problems have the properties of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.

## Use Cases

*   **Shortest Path Problems:** (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm).
*   **Sequence Alignment:** (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, Smith-Waterman algorithm).
*   **Knapsack Problem:**  Finding the most valuable items to include in a knapsack with a limited weight capacity.
*   **Chain Matrix Multiplication:**  Finding the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices.
*   **Longest Common Subsequence/Substring:** Finding the longest sequence/substring common to two strings.
*   **Fibonacci Sequence:** (Although there are more efficient ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers, it's a classic example of DP).
*   **Coin Change Problem:**  Finding the minimum number of coins to make a given amount.
* **Game Theory** Optimizing strategies.
