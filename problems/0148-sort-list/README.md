Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for problem 148, "Sort List".

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 148
*   **Problem Name:** Sort List
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0148-sort-list`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since no solution was provided, and the follow-up asks for O(n log n) time and O(1) space, we'll implement a merge sort solution (bottom-up, iterative approach for constant space). I'll also include a top-down recursive solution which isn't constant space.

First, we define the `ListNode` class which is necessary for linked list problems:

```python
# 0148-sort-list/list_node.py

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def list_to_linked_list(lst):
    dummy_head = ListNode()
    current = dummy_head
    for val in lst:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy_head.next

def linked_list_to_list(head):
    lst = []
    current = head
    while current:
        lst.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return lst

```
Now the iterative solution
```python
# 0148-sort-list/solution_iterative.py
# 148. Sort List - Iterative Merge Sort (Bottom-Up) - O(1) space

from .list_node import ListNode

def sortList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head

    # 1. Get the length of the linked list
    length = 0
    curr = head
    while curr:
        length += 1
        curr = curr.next

    # 2. Iteratively merge sublists
    dummy_head = ListNode(0)  # Important for linking
    dummy_head.next = head
    sub_length = 1

    while sub_length < length:
        prev = dummy_head
        curr = dummy_head.next

        while curr:
            # Split the list into two sublists of size sub_length
            head1 = curr
            for _ in range(sub_length):
                if curr:
                    curr = curr.next
                else:
                    break
            head2 = curr
            for _ in range(sub_length):
                if curr:
                    curr = curr.next
                else:
                    break

            # Important: Disconnect the sublists to merge correctly
            curr1 = head1
            for _ in range(sub_length -1):
                if curr1 and curr1.next != head2:
                    curr1 = curr1.next
                else: break
            if curr1:
                curr1.next = None
            
            curr2 = head2
            for _ in range(sub_length -1):
                if curr2 and curr2.next != curr:
                    curr2 = curr2.next
                else: break
            if curr2:    
                curr2.next = None


            # Merge the two sublists
            merged = merge(head1, head2)
            prev.next = merged

            # Move prev to the end of the merged sublist
            while prev.next:
                prev = prev.next

        sub_length *= 2

    return dummy_head.next


def merge(head1: ListNode, head2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    dummy_head = ListNode(0)
    curr = dummy_head

    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val <= head2.val:
            curr.next = head1
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            curr.next = head2
            head2 = head2.next
        curr = curr.next

    if head1:
        curr.next = head1
    if head2:
        curr.next = head2

    return dummy_head.next

```
Now the recursive one:
```python
# 0148-sort-list/solution_recursive.py
# 148. Sort List - Recursive Merge Sort (Top-Down)

from .list_node import ListNode

def sortList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head

    # 1. Split the list into two halves
    mid = get_middle(head)
    left = head
    right = mid.next
    mid.next = None  # Disconnect the two halves

    # 2. Recursively sort the two halves
    left = sortList(left)
    right = sortList(right)

    # 3. Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(left, right)


def get_middle(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    slow = head
    fast = head.next  # Start fast one step ahead for correct splitting

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    return slow


def merge(head1: ListNode, head2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    dummy_head = ListNode(0)
    curr = dummy_head

    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val <= head2.val:
            curr.next = head1
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            curr.next = head2
            head2 = head2.next
        curr = curr.next

    if head1:
        curr.next = head1
    if head2:
        curr.next = head2

    return dummy_head.next
```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

```markdown
# 148. Sort List, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

**Example 1:**

Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]

**Example 3:**

Input: head = []
Output: []

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
*   -10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in O(n log n) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?

## Approach(es)

### Iterative Merge Sort (Bottom-Up)

Algorithm:

1.  **Get Length:** Determine the length of the linked list.
2.  **Iterative Merging:**  Iterate with increasing sublist lengths (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).  In each iteration:
    *   Split the list into sublists of the current `sub_length`.  It's crucial to properly disconnect the sublists before merging.
    *   Merge adjacent sublists using a `merge` helper function (similar to merging in standard merge sort).
    *   Use a `dummy_head` to simplify linking the merged sublists.
    *   Update `prev` to point to the end of the last merged sublist.
3.  Return the sorted list (starting from `dummy_head.next`).

Data Structures:

*   Linked List Nodes

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n):  The list is divided and merged log n times, and each merge operation takes O(n) time.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1): This is the key advantage of the bottom-up approach.  We're only using a few pointers and modifying the list in place.

Trade-offs:

-   Iterative merge sort for linked lists is more complex to implement than the recursive version.
-   It avoids the stack space overhead of recursion, meeting the constant space requirement.

### Recursive Merge Sort (Top-Down)

Algorithm:

1.  **Base Case:** If the list is empty or has only one node, it's already sorted; return it.
2.  **Split:** Find the middle node of the list using the slow/fast pointer technique.  Disconnect the list into two halves at the middle.
3.  **Recursive Calls:** Recursively sort the left and right halves.
4.  **Merge:** Merge the two sorted halves using a `merge` helper function.

Data Structures:

*   Linked List Nodes

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n)

Space Complexity:

*   O(log n): Due to the recursive call stack.  Each level of recursion uses stack space.

Trade-offs:

-   Recursive merge sort is generally easier to understand and implement than the iterative version.
-   It uses O(log n) space due to the call stack, which doesn't satisfy the follow-up requirement.

## Notes (Optional)

*   The iterative merge sort is the preferred solution for this problem due to the constant space requirement.
*   The `get_middle` function is crucial for splitting the list in the recursive approach.
*  The bottom-up (iterative) merge sort is an excellent example of how to achieve constant space complexity in linked list sorting.
* Pay close attention to disconnecting sub-lists before merging.

# Linked List

## Explanation

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.

Key Concepts:

*   **Node:** The basic building block of a linked list, containing data and a pointer to the next node.
*   **Head:** The first node in the list.
*   **Tail:** The last node in the list (its `next` pointer is typically `None` or `null`).
*   **Singly Linked List:** Each node points only to the next node.
*   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
*   **Circular Linked List:** The last node's `next` pointer points back to the head.

Advantages:

*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as needed.
*   **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:** Inserting or deleting nodes is efficient (O(1)) if you have a pointer to the node before the insertion/deletion point.

Disadvantages:

*   **No Random Access:** Accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the head (O(n)).
*   **Extra Memory:**  Linked lists require extra memory for storing pointers.

Common uses:

*   Implementing stacks and queues.
*   Dynamic memory allocation.
*   Representing sparse matrices.
*   Implementing hash tables (chaining).

## Example (Python - Singly Linked List):
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# Creating a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3
head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(3)

# Traversing a linked list
current = head
while current:
    print(current.val)
    current = current.next

```

# Merge Sort

## Explanation

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing an array (or list) into smaller subarrays, sorting those subarrays, and then merging them back together to produce a sorted array.

Algorithm (Recursive):

1.  **Divide:** Divide the unsorted array into two halves.
2.  **Conquer:** Recursively sort the two subarrays.
3.  **Combine:** Merge the two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.

Key Concepts:

*   **Divide and Conquer:** The problem is broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
*   **Recursion:** Merge sort is naturally implemented recursively.
*   **Merging:** The core operation is merging two sorted subarrays efficiently.

Advantages:

*   **Stable:** Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm (maintains the relative order of equal elements).
*   **Guaranteed Performance:**  Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, worst).
*   **Well-Suited for Linked Lists:** Unlike some other sorting algorithms (like quicksort), merge sort can be implemented efficiently for linked lists without requiring random access.

Disadvantages:

*   **Space Complexity:**  Traditional merge sort requires O(n) auxiliary space for the merging process (though in-place variants exist).
* **Not adaptive**: Does not take advantage of the existing order.

## Example (Python - Array):
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0  # Indices for left, right, and merged arrays
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] <= right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # Copy remaining elements (if any)
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Divide and Conquer

## Explanation
Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by recursively breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

Key Steps:

1.  **Divide:** Break the problem into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size.
2.  **Conquer:** Solve the subproblems recursively. If the subproblem size is small enough (base case), solve it directly.
3.  **Combine:** Combine the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the original problem.

Advantages:

-   **Efficiency:**  Divide and conquer algorithms often lead to efficient solutions, often with logarithmic time complexity.
-   **Parallelism:** The subproblems are often independent and can be solved in parallel, making divide and conquer well-suited for parallel processing.
-   **Simplicity:**  Many complex problems can be expressed elegantly and concisely using divide and conquer.

Common Applications:

-   **Sorting:** Merge sort, quicksort.
-   **Searching:** Binary search.
-   **Matrix Multiplication:** Strassen's algorithm.
-   **Closest Pair of Points:** Finding the closest pair of points in a set of points.
-   **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Used in signal processing.
-   **Tree Traversals**

## Examples (Python):
```python
# Binary Search (Divide and Conquer)
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found

```
