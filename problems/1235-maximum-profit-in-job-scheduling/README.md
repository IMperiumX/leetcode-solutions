Okay, let's create the solution, README, and topic files for LeetCode problem 1235: "Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling". This is a classic dynamic programming problem that also involves sorting.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 1235
*   **Problem Name:** Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling
*   **Difficulty:** Hard

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

I will create a folder named `1235-maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Here's the breakdown of the most efficient approach, combining sorting and dynamic programming:

1.  **Combine and Sort:** Combine the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays into a single array of jobs (e.g., a list of tuples or a custom class). Sort the jobs based on their *end times* in ascending order.  This is crucial for the DP approach.
2.  **Dynamic Programming:** Use a `dp` array (or a dictionary for better space efficiency with sparse end times). `dp[i]` will store the maximum profit achievable considering jobs up to end time `i`.
3.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the sorted jobs.  For each job:
    -   Find the latest non-overlapping job that ends *before* the current job's start time. This can be done efficiently using binary search since the jobs are sorted by end times.
    -   Calculate the profit of including the current job:  `profit[current_job] + dp[end_time_of_previous_non_overlapping_job]`.
    -   Calculate the profit of *not* including the current job: `dp[end_time_of_previous_job]` (where "previous job" is the job that ends just before this one, regardless of overlap - we handle it by iterating through end times).
    -   Update `dp[end_time_of_current_job]` with the maximum of these two profits.
4.  **Result:** The maximum profit will be the maximum value in the `dp` array/dictionary.

# 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays. Return the *maximum profit* you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time ranges.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X`, you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job.
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job.
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4`
-   `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9`
-   `1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4`

## Approach(es)

### Dynamic Programming with Binary Search

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Combine and Sort:**
    -   Combine the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays into a single array of `jobs`.  Each job can be represented as a tuple `(endTime, startTime, profit)`.
    -   Sort the `jobs` array based on the `endTime` in ascending order.  This is essential for the dynamic programming approach.
2.  **Dynamic Programming:**
    -   Create a `dp` array of the same length as `jobs`.  `dp[i]` will store the maximum profit achievable considering jobs up to index `i` (inclusive) in the sorted `jobs` array.
    -   Initialize `dp[0]` with the profit of the first job (since jobs are sorted by end time).
3.  **Iteration:**
    -   Iterate through the sorted `jobs` array from index `i = 1` to `n-1`:
        -   `current_profit = jobs[i][2]` (profit of the current job).
        -   **Binary Search:** Find the latest non-overlapping job that ends *before* the current job's start time.  Perform a binary search on the sorted `jobs` array (from index 0 to `i-1`) to find the largest index `j` such that `jobs[j][0] <= jobs[i][1]` (end time of job `j` is less than or equal to the start time of job `i`).
        -   **Calculate Profit:**
            -   `include_profit`:  The profit if we *include* the current job.  This is equal to `current_profit` plus the maximum profit achievable up to the latest non-overlapping job (`dp[j]`, if such a job exists).
            -   `exclude_profit`:  The profit if we *exclude* the current job. This is simply the maximum profit achievable up to the previous job (`dp[i-1]`).
        -   **Update `dp`:**  `dp[i] = max(include_profit, exclude_profit)`.
4.  **Result:** Return `dp[n-1]`, which contains the maximum profit achievable considering all jobs.

**Data Structures:**

-   Array of tuples/objects (`jobs`)
-   `dp` array (list in Python)

**Time Complexity:**

-   Sorting: O(n log n), where n is the number of jobs.
-   DP Iteration: O(n log n) -  The outer loop iterates n times, and the binary search within the loop takes O(log n) time.
-   Overall: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(n) to store the `jobs` array and the `dp` array.

**Trade-offs:**

-   Efficient solution due to sorting and binary search.
-   Uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
-  The binary search is essential to achieve the O(n log n) time complexity. A linear search for the non-overlapping job would result in O(n^2) time complexity.

## Notes

- This problem combines sorting and dynamic programming, which is a common pattern in optimization problems.
- Sorting by end times is crucial because it allows us to efficiently find the latest non-overlapping job using binary search.
- The dynamic programming approach builds up solutions for subproblems (considering subsets of jobs) and uses them to find the optimal solution for the entire problem.
- The `dp` array stores the maximum profit achievable *up to a certain job*, not necessarily *including* that job.
- The binary search optimizes the process of finding the latest non-overlapping job, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

# Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).  It's a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in many algorithms.

## Key Concepts

-   **Comparison-Based Sorting:**  Algorithms that compare elements to determine their relative order (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
-   **Non-Comparison-Based Sorting:**  Algorithms that don't rely on comparisons (e.g., Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort). These are often faster but have restrictions on the types of data they can handle.
-   **In-Place Sorting:** Algorithms that sort the data within the original array without using significant extra space (e.g., Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
-   **Stable Sorting:** Algorithms that preserve the relative order of equal elements (e.g., Merge Sort, Insertion Sort).
-   **Adaptive Sorting:**  Algorithms whose performance improves if the input is partially sorted (e.g., Insertion Sort, some variations of Quick Sort).

## Common Sorting Algorithms

-   **Bubble Sort:**  Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  Simple but inefficient (O(n^2)).
-   **Selection Sort:**  Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning.  Simple but inefficient (O(n^2)).
-   **Insertion Sort:**  Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position in the already sorted portion.  Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data (O(n^2) in general, but O(n) for nearly sorted data).
-   **Merge Sort:**  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array in half, sorts the halves, and then merges the sorted halves.  Efficient and stable (O(n log n)).
-   **Quick Sort:**  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot, placing smaller elements before the pivot and larger elements after it.  Efficient on average (O(n log n)), but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.
-   **Heap Sort:**  Uses a binary heap data structure to sort the array.  Efficient (O(n log n)) and in-place.
-   **Counting Sort:**  A non-comparison-based algorithm that counts the occurrences of each element and uses the counts to determine the sorted positions.  Efficient for integers with a limited range (O(n + k), where k is the range of values).
-   **Radix Sort:**  A non-comparison-based algorithm that sorts elements digit by digit (or by some other grouping).  Efficient for integers or strings with a fixed length (O(nk), where k is the number of digits/characters).
-   **Bucket Sort:** A non-comparison based sort, working best on uniform distributions

| Radix Sort      | O(nk)       | O(nk)        | O(nk)       | O(n + k)         | Yes    | No       |
| Bucket Sort     | O(n+k)      | O(n+k)        | O(n^2)      | O(n)             | Yes    | No          |
