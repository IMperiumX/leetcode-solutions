**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `1730-shortest-path-to-get-food`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since a solution wasn't provided, we'll generate a Python solution using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is the appropriate algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (which the grid represents).

```python
# 1730. Shortest Path to Get Food - BFS Approach

from collections import deque

def getFood(grid):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    start_row, start_col = -1, -1

    # Find the starting position ('*')
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '*':
                start_row, start_col = r, c
                break
        if start_row != -1:
            break

    queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])  # (row, col, distance)
    visited = {(start_row, start_col)}
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # Possible moves (right, left, down, up)

    while queue:
        row, col, distance = queue.popleft()

        if grid[row][col] == '#':  # Found food!
            return distance

        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            # Check boundaries and if the new position is valid and not visited
            if (0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols and
                grid[new_row][new_col] != 'X' and (new_row, new_col) not in visited):
                queue.append((new_row, new_col, distance + 1))
                visited.add((new_row, new_col))

    return -1  # No food found
```

# 1730. Shortest Path to Get Food, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You are given a 2D character grid, `grid`, of dimension `m x n`, and it is guaranteed that there is **exactly one** `*` in the `grid` where `*` is your location. There may be multiple food cells in the grid as well, and each food cell is represented by `#`. You can travel to any adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) in one step. Return *the length of the shortest path for you to reach any food cell*. If there is no path to a food cell, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

Input: `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","O","O","X"],["X","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X"]]`
Output: `3`
Explanation: It takes 3 steps to reach the food.

**Example 2:**

Input: `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","#","X"],["X","X","X","X","X"]]`
Output: `-1`
Explanation: It is not possible to reach the food.

**Example 3:**
Input: `grid = [["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"],["X","*","O","X","O","#","O","X"],["X","O","O","X","O","O","X","X"],["X","O","O","O","O","#","O","X"],["X","X","X","X","X","X","X","X"]]`
Output: `6`

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `'X'`, `'*'`, `'O'`, or `'#'`.
*   The grid contains exactly one `'*'`.

## Approach(es)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Since we need to find the *shortest* path in an unweighted grid (where each step has a cost of 1), Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the most appropriate algorithm.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Find Starting Position:** Iterate through the grid to find the coordinates of the starting cell ('\*').
2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a queue (`deque` in Python) to store cells to visit.  Each element in the queue will be a tuple: `(row, col, distance)`.
    *   Create a set `visited` to keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles.
    *   Enqueue the starting cell with a distance of 0: `queue.append((start_row, start_col, 0))`.
    *   Add the starting cell to the `visited` set.
3.  **BFS Traversal:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a cell: `row, col, distance = queue.popleft()`.
    *   **Check for Food:** If `grid[row][col] == '#'`: return `distance`.
    *   **Explore Neighbors:** Iterate through the four possible directions (up, down, left, right):
        *   Calculate the coordinates of the neighboring cell: `new_row = row + dr`, `new_col = col + dc`.
        *   **Check Validity:** Ensure the neighbor is within bounds, not an obstacle ('X'), and not visited:
            ```
            0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols and grid[new_row][new_col] != 'X' and (new_row, new_col) not in visited
            ```
        *   If the neighbor is valid, enqueue it with an incremented distance: `queue.append((new_row, new_col, distance + 1))`.
        *   Add the neighbor to the `visited` set.
4.  **No Food Found:** If the queue becomes empty and no food cell is found, return `-1`.

**Data Structures:**

*   Queue (`collections.deque`): To store cells to visit in BFS order.
*   Set (`visited`): To keep track of visited cells.

**Time Complexity:** O(m\*n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. In the worst case, we might visit all cells.

**Space Complexity:** O(m\*n) in the worst case, where the queue and the visited set might store all cells (e.g., if the entire grid is free space).  In practice, the space used will often be less.

**Trade-offs:**

*   BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (or grid).
*   The space complexity can be O(m\*n) in the worst case, but it's often less in practice.

## Notes

* This problem is a classic application of BFS for finding the shortest path.
* The use of a `visited` set is crucial to prevent infinite loops and ensure correctness.
* The `directions` array makes the neighbor exploration concise and readable.
