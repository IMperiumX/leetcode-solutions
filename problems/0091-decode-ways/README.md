# 91. Decode Ways, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:

"1" -> 'A'

"2" -> 'B'

...

"25" -> 'Y'

"26" -> 'Z'

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").

For example, "11106" can be decoded into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).
Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").  In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= s.length <= 100
*   s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

## Approach(es)

### Memoization (Top-Down DP)

Algorithm:

1.  **Base Cases:**
    *   If we reach the end of the string (`index == len(s)`), we have found a valid decoding, so return 1.
    *   If the current digit is '0', it cannot be decoded (leading zero), so return 0.
2.  **Memoization:** Use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems (number of ways to decode from a given index). If we have already calculated the result for an index, return it from `memo`.
3.  **Recursive Steps:**
    *   Calculate the number of ways to decode by considering the current digit as a single-digit code (`decode(index + 1)`).
    *   If the current digit and the next digit form a valid two-digit code (10-26), add the number of ways to decode from two digits ahead (`decode(index + 2)`).
4.  Store the result in `memo` before returning.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (`memo`): For memoization.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each subproblem is solved only once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) for the `memo` dictionary and the recursion call stack.

Trade-offs:
- More intuitive to understand the flow of recursive calls.
- Can have some overhead from function calls.

### Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP)

Algorithm:

1.  Create a DP array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to decode the substring `s[:i]`.
2.  **Base Case:** `dp[n] = 1` (empty string has one way to decode).
3.  Iterate from `n - 1` down to 0:
    *   If `s[i] == '0'`, set `dp[i] = 0` (leading zero).
    *   Otherwise, set `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` (decode as a single digit).
    *   If a valid two-digit code can be formed, add `dp[i + 2]` to `dp[i]`.
4.  Return `dp[0]`.

Data Structures:

*   Array (`dp`): For storing results of subproblems.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) for the `dp` array.

Trade-offs:
-  Can be slightly more efficient than memoization due to the absence of function call overhead.
- The logic might be slightly less intuitive to follow initially, but it often leads to more concise code.

# Dynamic Programming

## Explanation

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.  It's particularly useful for problems where a brute-force approach would lead to exponential time complexity.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Optimal Substructure:** A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:**  The same subproblems are encountered multiple times during the recursive solution of the problem.

**Approaches:**

1.  **Memoization (Top-Down):**
    *   Start with the original problem and recursively break it down into subproblems.
    *   Use a data structure (usually a dictionary or hash map) to store the solutions to subproblems as they are computed.
    *   Before making a recursive call, check if the solution to the subproblem has already been computed. If so, return the stored solution; otherwise, compute it, store it, and then return it.

2.  **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**
    *   Start with the smallest subproblems and build up solutions to larger subproblems iteratively.
    *   Use a table (usually an array or matrix) to store the solutions to subproblems.
    *   Fill the table in a specific order, ensuring that the solutions to smaller subproblems are available when needed to compute solutions to larger subproblems.

**Advantages:**

*   **Efficiency:**  DP can significantly reduce time complexity compared to brute-force approaches by avoiding redundant computations.
*   **Optimality:**  DP guarantees finding the optimal solution (if one exists) for problems with optimal substructure.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Memory Usage:** DP often requires extra memory to store the solutions to subproblems (memoization table or tabulation table).
*   **Complexity:**  Identifying the subproblems and formulating the recurrence relation can sometimes be challenging.

**Common Applications:**

*   **Shortest Path Problems:** (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm)
*   **Knapsack Problem:**  Finding the most valuable subset of items that can fit into a knapsack with a limited capacity.
*   **Sequence Alignment:**  Finding the best alignment between two sequences (e.g., DNA sequences).
*   **Longest Common Subsequence/Substring:** Finding the longest common subsequence or substring between two strings.
*   **Fibonacci Sequence:** Computing Fibonacci numbers efficiently.
* **Decode Ways.**

# String Manipulation

## Explanation
String manipulation refers to the various operations that can be performed on strings, which are sequences of characters. These operations include modifying, analyzing, and extracting information from strings. String manipulation is a fundamental aspect of many programming tasks, particularly in areas like text processing, data parsing, and web development.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
*   **Slicing:** Extracting a portion (substring) of a string.
*   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a specific character or substring within a string.
*   **Replacing:** Substituting parts of a string with other characters or substrings.
*   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
*   **Joining:** Combining a list of strings into a single string, using a specified separator.
*   **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of characters (uppercase, lowercase).
*   **Trimming:** Removing leading and trailing whitespace (or other specified characters).
*   **Length Calculation:** Determining the number of characters in a string.
*   **Formatting:** Creating strings with specific formatting, such as inserting values into placeholders.
*  **Character Access:** Access individual characters within string using indexing.
