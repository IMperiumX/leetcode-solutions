**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** The problem description defines the "Backspace String Compare" problem.  We need to compare two strings after processing backspace characters ('#').  This is LeetCode problem 844, and it is an Easy problem.

    *   **Output:** Problem Number: 844, Problem Name: Backspace String Compare, Difficulty: Easy

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0844-backspace-string-compare`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2:**  I will generate solutions in Python.  I'll implement two approaches:
    1.  **Two-Pointer (O(1) space):**  This addresses the follow-up, processing the strings from the end.
    2.  **Stack (O(n) space):** A more intuitive, but less space-efficient solution.

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common and efficient approach for solving problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (usually indices) to traverse the data structure, often from opposite ends or moving at different speeds. This technique can significantly reduce time complexity compared to nested loops or brute-force approaches.

## Common Patterns

*   **Opposite Ends:** Two pointers start at the beginning and end of the data structure and move towards each other.  This is useful for problems like palindrome checking, finding pairs that sum to a target, or reversing an array in place.
*   **Same Direction (Fast and Slow):** Two pointers start at the same position but move at different speeds. This is often used in linked list problems to detect cycles, find the middle element, or find the nth element from the end.
*   **Sliding Window:** Two pointers define a "window" within the data structure, and the window slides across the data. This is helpful for problems involving subarrays or substrings, such as finding the longest substring with unique characters or finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a given size.
*    **Multiple Arrays/Strings:** Two pointers traverse separate arrays/strings.

## Advantages of Two Pointers

*   **Efficiency:** Can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) or from O(n log n) to O(n).
*   **Space Efficiency:** Often requires only constant extra space (O(1)).
*   **Readability:** Can make code more concise and easier to understand compared to nested loops.

## When to Consider Two Pointers

*   The problem involves arrays, strings, or linked lists.
*   The problem requires finding a pair, a subsequence, or a specific condition that involves comparing elements at different positions.
*   The data structure is sorted (but not always required).
*   In-place modification is desired (for problems like reversing or removing elements).

# Stacks

Stacks are a fundamental linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.  The last element added to the stack is the first element removed.  Think of a stack of plates â€“ you add plates to the top and remove plates from the top.

## Key Concepts

*   **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** The element most recently added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
*   **Push:**  Adding an element to the top of the stack.
*   **Pop:** Removing the element from the top of the stack.
*   **Peek (or Top):**  Retrieving the value of the top element without removing it.
*   **isEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
*   **isFull:** Checking if the stack is full (relevant for array-based implementations with a fixed size).

## Common Stack Operations

*   **push(element):** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
*   **pop():** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
*   **peek():** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
*   **empty():** Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Implementations

*   **Array-based:** Stacks can be implemented using arrays.  In this case, the stack has a fixed capacity.
*   **Linked List-based:** Stacks can also be implemented using linked lists.  This allows for dynamic resizing.  Each node in the linked list represents an element in the stack.

## Common Stack Applications

*   **Function Call Stack:**  Used by programming languages to manage function calls.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:**  Storing previous states of an application.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Evaluating arithmetic expressions (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
*   **Backtracking Algorithms:**  Exploring different solution paths (e.g., solving mazes).
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Traversing graphs and trees.

# 844. Backspace String Compare, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

Example 2:

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".

Example 3:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Follow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

## Approach(es)

### Two-Pointer Approach (O(1) space)

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize two pointers, `i` for string `s` and `j` for string `t`, starting at the end of each string.
2.  Initialize `skip_s` and `skip_t` to 0, representing the number of backspaces encountered.
3.  Iterate while either `i` or `j` is non-negative:
    *   **Find the next valid character in `s`:**
        *   While `i` is within bounds:
            *   If `s[i]` is '#', increment `skip_s` and decrement `i`.
            *   Else if `skip_s` is greater than 0, decrement `skip_s` and `i`.
            *   Else, break (we've found the next valid character).
    *   **Find the next valid character in `t`:** (Same logic as for `s`)
    *   **Compare the characters:**
        *   If both `i` and `j` are within bounds, compare `s[i]` and `t[j]`. If they are different, return `False`.
        *   If only one of `i` or `j` is within bounds, it means the strings have different lengths after backspace processing, so return `False`.
    *   Decrement `i` and `j`.
4.  Return `True` (if we've reached this point, the strings are equal).

Data Structures:

*   No extra data structures are used.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the maximum length of the two strings.  We iterate through the strings at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and skip counts.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is very efficient in terms of space complexity.  It processes the strings in reverse, effectively simulating the backspace operations without needing to build new strings or use stacks.

### Stack Approach (O(n) space)

Algorithm:

1.  Define a helper function `build_stack(string)`:
    *   Initialize an empty stack.
    *   Iterate through the string:
        *   If the character is not '#', push it onto the stack.
        *   If the character is '#' and the stack is not empty, pop from the stack.
    *   Return the stack.
2.  Compare the stacks returned by `build_stack(s)` and `build_stack(t)`.  Return `True` if they are equal, `False` otherwise.

Data Structures:

*   Stacks to store the characters after backspace processing.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the maximum length of the two strings.  We iterate through each string once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) in the worst case, where n is the maximum length of the input strings. This occurs when there are no backspace characters, and we store the entire string in the stack.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is more intuitive and easier to read than the two-pointer approach. However, it uses extra space for the stacks.

[Stack Approach](./solution_stack.py)

## Notes

The two-pointer approach is the optimal solution, satisfying the follow-up requirement of O(1) space complexity.  It demonstrates a clever way to handle backspaces by iterating in reverse. The stack-based solution is a good alternative if space complexity is not a major concern.
