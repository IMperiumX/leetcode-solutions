**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem... Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters... return the length of the longest palindrome..."

*   **Analysis:** The problem description matches "Longest Palindrome" (we need to find the *length* of the longest palindrome that can be *built*, not a substring). It is the problem number 409.

*   **Output:** Problem Number: 409, Problem Name: Longest Palindrome, Difficulty: Easy

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create directory: `0409-longest-palindrome`

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2:** Generate solutions in Python.

*   **File: `0409-longest-palindrome/solution.py`** (Hash Table/Counter Approach)

```python
# 409. Longest Palindrome - Hash Table/Counter Approach
from collections import Counter

def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with the
    letters in the input string s.
    """
    counts = Counter(s)  # Count the frequency of each character
    length = 0
    odd_found = False

    for count in counts.values():
        if count % 2 == 0:  # Even count: add directly to the length
            length += count
        else:  # Odd count: add (count - 1) and set odd_found flag
            length += count - 1
            odd_found = True

    if odd_found:  # If there was at least one odd count, add 1 for the center
        length += 1

    return length

```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

# 409. Longest Palindrome, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest *palindrome* that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.

## Approach(es)

### Hash Table/Counter Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Use a hash table (or `collections.Counter` in Python) to count the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
2.  Initialize `length = 0` (to store the length of the longest palindrome) and `odd_found = False` (to track if we've encountered a character with an odd count).
3.  Iterate through the character counts:
    *   If the count is even, add the count to `length`.
    *   If the count is odd, add `count - 1` to `length` and set `odd_found = True`.  (We can use all but one occurrence of an odd-count character in pairs).
4.  After iterating through all counts, if `odd_found` is `True`, it means we can add one character in the middle of the palindrome (the single occurrence of a character with an odd count).  So, add 1 to `length`.
5.  Return `length`.

Data Structures:

*   Hash Table/Counter: To store character frequencies.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once to count characters and then iterate through the counts (which is at most the number of distinct characters, which is less than or equal to n).

Space Complexity:

*   O(1). The space used by the hash table is limited by the size of the character set (lowercase and uppercase English letters), which is a constant (52).  So, even though we are technically using a hash table, its size is bounded by a constant, making the space complexity O(1).

Trade-offs:

* This solution is efficient in both time and memory.

## Notes
* It is important to understand that we are not asked to return the substring.
* This question can be solved with a greedy approach.

# Hash Table

A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.  A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Key Concepts

*   **Hash Function:** A function that takes a key as input and returns an integer, called a hash code.  A good hash function should distribute keys uniformly across the buckets to minimize collisions.
*   **Collision:** When two different keys produce the same hash code.
*   **Collision Resolution:** Techniques for handling collisions, such as:
    *   **Separate Chaining:**  Each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
    *   **Open Addressing:**  If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for an empty slot in the array using a probing sequence (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing).

## Advantages of Hash Tables

*   **Fast Average-Case Performance:** Hash tables offer O(1) average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.  This makes them very efficient for lookups.
*   **Flexibility:** Hash tables can store key-value pairs of various data types.

## Disadvantages of Hash Tables

*   **Worst-Case Performance:** In the worst case (e.g., all keys hash to the same bucket), the time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements.
*   **Space Overhead:** Hash tables can require extra space for the buckets, especially if the load factor (the ratio of elements to buckets) is low.
* **Unordered:** By their nature, hash tables do not store elements in any particular order.

## Common Uses

*   **Dictionaries and Sets:**  Hash tables are commonly used to implement dictionaries (maps) and sets.
*   **Caching:** Hash tables can be used to implement caches, where frequently accessed data is stored for quick retrieval.
*   **Database Indexing:** Hash tables are used in database systems for indexing.
*   **Symbol Tables:** Compilers use hash tables to store information about variables and functions.

# Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Local Optimality:** At each step, the algorithm makes the choice that looks best at the moment, without considering the consequences for future steps.
*   **Irrevocable Decisions:** Once a choice is made, it cannot be undone.
*   **Not Always Optimal:** Greedy algorithms do not always guarantee finding the globally optimal solution.  However, for some problems, they do produce the optimal solution (e.g., finding a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm).

## When to Use Greedy Algorithms

*   **Optimization Problems:** Problems where the goal is to find the best solution (maximum or minimum) among all possible solutions.
*   **Problems with Optimal Substructure (can overlap with Dynamic Programing):**  The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. This is a necessary condition for Dynamic Programing.
*   **Problems with the Greedy Choice Property:**  A globally optimal solution can be obtained by making a locally optimal (greedy) choice.  This is the key property that distinguishes greedy algorithms from dynamic programming.

## Advantages of Greedy Algorithms

*   **Simplicity:** Greedy algorithms are often simple to design and implement.
*   **Efficiency:** Greedy algorithms can be very efficient, often with linear or near-linear time complexity.

## Disadvantages of Greedy Algorithms

*   **Not Always Correct:**  The main disadvantage is that greedy algorithms do not always find the optimal solution.  It's crucial to prove the correctness of a greedy algorithm before using it.
*   **Proof of Correctness:** Proving that a greedy algorithm produces the optimal solution can be challenging.

## Examples of Greedy Algorithms

*   **Activity Selection Problem:**  Selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a set of activities with start and finish times.
*   **Fractional Knapsack Problem:**  Filling a knapsack with items to maximize the total value, where you can take fractions of items.
*   **Huffman Coding:**  A data compression algorithm that uses a greedy approach to construct a variable-length prefix code.
*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Find the shortest path in a weighted graph (for non-negative edge weights).
*   **Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms:**  Finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph.
