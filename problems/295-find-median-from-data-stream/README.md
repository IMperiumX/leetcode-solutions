import heapq

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.small = []  # Max-heap (stores smaller half) - use negative values
        self.large = []  # Min-heap (stores larger half)

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if len(self.small) == len(self.large):

# obj = MedianFinder()
# obj.addNum(num)
# param_2 = obj.findMedian()

# Heap (Priority Queue)

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the *heap property*.  Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.  The heap property dictates the relationship between a parent node and its children:

*   **Min-Heap:**  For every node, the value of the node is less than or equal to the value of its children.  The smallest element is always at the root.
*   **Max-Heap:** For every node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the value of its children. The largest element is always at the root.

## Common Heap Implementations

Heaps are typically implemented using arrays, although they conceptually represent a tree structure.  The array representation is efficient and leverages the properties of a complete binary tree (a binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right).

*   **Array Representation:**
    *   The root is at index 0.
    *   For a node at index `i`:
        *   Its left child is at index `2 * i + 1`.
        *   Its right child is at index `2 * i + 2`.
        *   Its parent is at index `(i - 1) // 2`.

## Operations and Time Complexity

*   **`insert(value)` (or `push(value)`):**  Adds a new value to the heap.
    1.  Add the new value to the end of the array (bottom of the tree).
    2.  "Heapify up" (or "bubble up"):  Compare the new value with its parent.  If the heap property is violated (e.g., in a min-heap, the new value is smaller than its parent), swap the new value with its parent.  Repeat this process until the heap property is restored or the new value reaches the root.
    *   Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.

*   **`find_min()` (or `peek()` for min-heap) / `find_max()` (or `peek()` for max-heap):**  Returns the minimum (for min-heap) or maximum (for max-heap) element without removing it.
    *   Time Complexity: O(1) - The minimum/maximum element is always at the root.

*   **`extract_min()` (or `pop()` for min-heap) / `extract_max()` (or `pop()` for max-heap):** Removes and returns the minimum (for min-heap) or maximum (for max-heap) element.
    1.  Swap the root element with the last element in the array.
    2.  Remove the last element (which was the original root).
    3.  "Heapify down" (or "bubble down"): Compare the new root with its children. If the heap property is violated, swap the root with the smaller (for min-heap) or larger (for max-heap) child. Repeat this process until the heap property is restored or the node becomes a leaf.
    *   Time Complexity: O(log n)

* **`heapify(list)`:** Build a heap from an unordered list of elements.
    *   Time Complexity: O(n).  Although it might seem like O(n log n) because we potentially call heapify_down on each element, a tighter analysis shows that it's actually O(n).

## Advantages of Heaps

*   **Efficient Priority Queue Implementation:** Heaps are the standard way to implement priority queues.
*   **Guaranteed Logarithmic Time for Key Operations:** Insertion, deletion of the minimum/maximum element, and (with some modifications) updating priorities are all O(log n).
* **Find Min/Max in O(1) Time.**
*   **In-Place Sorting (Heapsort):** Heaps can be used for an efficient in-place sorting algorithm called heapsort.

## Disadvantages of Heaps

*   **Not a General-Purpose Data Structure:** Heaps are specialized for finding and removing the minimum/maximum element.  They are not efficient for searching for arbitrary elements.
*   **Implementation Can Be Tricky:** While the concept is simple, the implementation details (especially heapify up/down) can be prone to errors if not done carefully.

## Use Cases

*   **Priority Queues:**  Scheduling tasks, managing events, implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, Huffman coding.
*   **Heapsort:**  An efficient sorting algorithm.
*   **Finding the k Largest/Smallest Elements:**  Efficiently finding the k largest or smallest elements in a stream of data.
*   **Operating System Schedulers:**
*   **Graph Algorithms:**

# 295. Find Median from Data Stream, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

*   For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
*   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the `MedianFinder` class:

*   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
*   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
*   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `-10^5 <= num <= 10^5`
*   There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
*   At most `5 * 10^4` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

**Follow up:**

*   If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
*   If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?

## Approach(es)

### Two Heaps Approach (Optimal)

Algorithm:

1.  **Two Heaps:** Use two heaps (priority queues):
    *   `small`: A max-heap to store the smaller half of the numbers. We store negative values in `small` to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq` module (which is a min-heap implementation).
    *   `large`: A min-heap to store the larger half of the numbers.
2.  **`addNum(num)`:**
    *   Maintain the invariant that `len(small)` is either equal to `len(large)` or one greater than `len(large)`.
    * If `len(small) == len(large)`, add the number to `small` first, pop the largest element, then add it to the `large`.
    * If `len(small) < len(large)`, add the number to `large` first, pop the smallest element, then add it to the `small`.
3.  **`findMedian()`:**
    *   If `len(small) == len(large)`, the median is the average of the top elements of `small` and `large`.
    *   Otherwise, the median is the top element of `large`.

Data Structures:

*   Two Heaps (Priority Queues): Implemented using the `heapq` module in Python.

Time Complexity:

*   `addNum`: O(log n), where n is the number of elements added so far.  Heap operations (push and pop) take logarithmic time.
*   `findMedian`: O(1) - Accessing the top elements of the heaps takes constant time.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) -  The heaps store all the numbers added so far.

Trade-offs:

*   This is the most efficient approach for finding the median in a data stream. It provides logarithmic time complexity for adding numbers and constant time complexity for finding the median.

## Notes (Optional)

*   **Follow-up Optimizations:**
    *   **All numbers in [0, 100]:**  We could use a counting sort approach.  Create an array of size 101 to store the counts of each number.  To find the median, iterate through the array, keeping track of the cumulative count, until you reach the middle element(s). This would make `addNum` O(1) and `findMedian` O(101) which is effectively O(1).

    *   **99% of numbers in [0, 100]:**  Use a hybrid approach.  Use a counting sort array for the numbers in the range [0, 100]. Use the two-heap approach for numbers outside this range. Keep track of the total count of numbers and the count of numbers within the [0, 100] range.  When finding the median, determine if it falls within the [0, 100] range based on the counts. If it does, find the median using the counting sort array. Otherwise, use the two heaps to determine how many elements from each heap contribute to median.
