# 143. Reorder List, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L<sub>0</sub> → L<sub>1</sub> → … → L<sub>n - 1</sub> → L<sub>n</sub>

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L<sub>0</sub> → L<sub>n</sub> → L<sub>1</sub> → L<sub>n - 1</sub> → L<sub>2</sub> → L<sub>n - 2</sub> → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

**Example 2:**

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range \[1, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
*   1 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Approach(es)

### Three-Step Approach (Find Middle, Reverse, Merge)

Algorithm:

1.  **Find the Middle:** Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle node of the linked list.  The slow pointer will be at the middle (or the first node of the second half if the list has an even number of nodes) when the fast pointer reaches the end.
2.  **Reverse the Second Half:** Reverse the portion of the linked list starting from the node *after* the middle node (which `slow` points to).  Disconnect the first half from the second half by setting `slow.next = None`.
3.  **Merge the Two Halves:**  Merge the original first half and the reversed second half in an alternating fashion.  Start with the head of the first half and the head of the reversed second half.

Data Structures:

*   Linked List:  The input is a singly linked list.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.  We traverse the list multiple times, but each traversal is linear.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.  The reversal is done in-place.

Trade-offs:
- This three-step approach breaks down the problem into manageable subproblems.
- It achieves the in-place reordering requirement efficiently.

# Linked List

## Explanation

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.  This gives linked lists flexibility in terms of insertion and deletion, but it also means that accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the head.

**Types of Linked Lists:**

*   **Singly Linked List:**  Each node has a pointer to the next node only.
*   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes. This allows for traversal in both directions.
*   **Circular Linked List:** The last node's pointer points back to the head, forming a cycle.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Insertion:**  Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or a specific position within the list.
*   **Deletion:** Removing a node from the list.
*   **Traversal:** Visiting each node in the list, typically to search for a value or perform some operation on each node.
*   **Search:** Finding a node with a specific value.
*   **Reversal:** Reversing the order of the nodes in the list.

**Advantages:**

*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as needed.
*   **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:** Inserting or deleting nodes in the middle of a linked list is generally more efficient than in an array (which might require shifting elements).

**Disadvantages:**

*   **No Random Access:** Accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the head, which takes O(n) time in the worst case.
*   **Extra Memory Overhead:** Each node requires extra memory to store the pointer(s).

# Two Pointers

## Explanation
The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (indices or references) that move through the data structure, often from opposite ends or in the same direction, to efficiently find a solution. This approach can significantly reduce time complexity compared to brute-force methods.

**Common Patterns:**

1.  **Opposite Ends:** Two pointers start at the beginning and end of the array and move towards each other.  This is often used for problems involving sorted arrays or palindromes.
2.  **Same Direction (Sliding Window):** Two pointers start at the beginning of the array and move in the same direction.  The "window" between the pointers represents a sub-array or sub-string that is being considered.  This is useful for finding sub-arrays/sub-strings that meet certain criteria.
3.  **Fast and Slow Pointers:**  Two pointers move at different speeds. This is commonly used in linked list problems to detect cycles or find the middle node.
4.  **Multiple Arrays/Strings:** Two (or more) pointers are used to traverse multiple arrays or strings simultaneously.

**Advantages:**

*   **Efficiency:**  Often reduces time complexity to O(n) or O(n log n), where n is the size of the input.
*   **Space Efficiency:**  Typically requires only O(1) extra space (for the pointers).
*   **Versatility:**  Applicable to a wide range of problems.

**Disadvantages:**

*   May require careful handling of edge cases and pointer movement.
*   Not always the most intuitive approach for all problems.

**Example Scenarios and Algorithms:**

*   **Two Sum (Sorted Array):** Given a sorted array and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target. (Opposite Ends)
*   **Valid Palindrome:** Determine if a string is a palindrome. (Opposite Ends)
*   **Subarray Sum Equals K:** Find a contiguous sub-array that sums to a given value. (Sliding Window)
*   **Linked List Cycle Detection:** Determine if a linked list has a cycle. (Fast and Slow Pointers)
*   **Merge Sorted Arrays:** Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. (Multiple Arrays)
*   **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:** Remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place. (Same Direction)
*   **3Sum:** Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero. (Combination of sorting and two-pointer techniques).
*   **Container With Most Water:** Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water. (Opposite Ends).

# In-Place Algorithm
## Explanation

An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms input using no auxiliary data structure or constant extra space. However, a small, constant amount of extra storage space is allowed for variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithms are commonly used to save memory when working with large datasets.
**Advantages:**

*   **Memory Efficiency:** In-place algorithms use a minimal or constant amount of extra memory.
*   **Cache Locality:** Operating directly on the input data can improve cache performance.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Destructive:** In-place algorithms modify the input data, which might not be desirable in all cases. It's important to create a copy if the original data needs to be preserved.
*   **Complexity:** Some in-place algorithms can be more complex to implement and understand compared to their out-of-place counterparts.

**Example Problem**
* [48. Rotate Image](./0048-rotate-image/README.md)
* [143. Reorder List](./0143-reorder-list/README.md)
