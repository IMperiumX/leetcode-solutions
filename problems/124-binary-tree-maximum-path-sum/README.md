# Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. They are widely used in computer science to represent relationships between data elements.  Unlike linear data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues), trees organize data in a non-linear fashion.

## Basic Tree Terminology

*   **Node:**  A fundamental unit of a tree, containing data and links to other nodes.
*   **Root:** The topmost node in a tree.  There is only one root node.
*   **Parent:** A node that has a direct connection to another node (its child).
*   **Child:** A node that is directly connected to another node (its parent).
*   **Leaf:** A node with no children.
*   **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
*   **Depth (of a node):** The length of the path (number of edges) from the root to that node.
*   **Height (of a tree):** The maximum depth of any node in the tree (length of the longest path from the root to a leaf).
*   **Subtree:** A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.
* **Sibling:** Nodes with the same parent.

## Types of Trees

There are many different types of trees, each with specific properties and use cases. Some common ones include:

*   **Binary Tree:**  Each node has at most two children (referred to as the left child and the right child).
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):**  A binary tree with the property that for each node:
    *   All values in the left subtree are less than the node's value.
    *   All values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
*   **AVL Tree:**  A self-balancing BST where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, preventing worst-case scenarios for operations.
*   **Red-Black Tree:** Another type of self-balancing BST, using "color" properties (red or black) for nodes to maintain balance.
*   **Trie (Prefix Tree):**  A tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
*   **Heap:**  A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (either min-heap or max-heap).

## Binary Tree Traversals

Traversals are methods for visiting all nodes in a tree in a specific order.  Common traversal methods for binary trees include:

*   **Inorder Traversal:**  Visit left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree.  For a BST, this visits the nodes in sorted order.
*   **Preorder Traversal:** Visit the current node, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
*   **Postorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the current node.
*   **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search):** Visit nodes level by level, from left to right.

## Advantages of Trees

*   **Hierarchical Representation:**  Naturally represent hierarchical relationships.
*   **Efficient Searching (for balanced trees):**  BSTs, AVL trees, and Red-Black trees provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations (O(log n) on average).
*   **Flexibility:**  Can be used to implement various other data structures and algorithms.

## Disadvantages of Trees

*   **Unbalanced Trees:**  If a tree becomes unbalanced, operations can degrade to O(n) complexity (similar to a linked list).
*   **Implementation Complexity:**  Some tree types (like self-balancing trees) can be more complex to implement than simpler data structures.

## Use Cases

*   **File Systems:** Representing directories and files.
*   **Databases:**  Indexing and organizing data.
*   **Compilers:**  Syntax trees.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Representing mathematical expressions.
*   **Network Routing:**  Finding optimal paths in a network.
*   **Decision Trees (Machine Learning):** Representing decision-making processes.
* **Game AI:**

# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the maximum path sum of any non-empty path*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Approach(es)

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Global Variable:** Initialize a global variable `max_sum` to negative infinity. This variable will store the maximum path sum found so far.
2.  **Recursive Helper Function (`max_gain`):** Create a recursive helper function `max_gain(node)` that takes a node as input and returns the maximum *gain* from that node. The "gain" is the maximum path sum that *includes* the current node and extends downwards into either its left or right subtree (but not both, as that would form a path that's not a simple path).
    *   **Base Case:** If the `node` is `None`, return 0 (no gain from an empty subtree).
    *   **Recursive Calls:** Recursively calculate the maximum gain from the left and right subtrees: `left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0)` and `right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0)`. We take the `max` with 0 to ignore negative gains (it's better to not include a subtree with a negative sum).
    * **Calculate Price to Start a New Path:** `price_newpath = node.val + left_gain + right_gain`
    *   **Update `max_sum`:** Update `max_sum` with the maximum of its current value and `price_newpath` sum (node.val + left_gain + right_gain`). This represents a path that *might* go through the current node as its "peak" (connecting left and right subtrees).
    *   **Return Max Gain:** Return the maximum gain from the current node, which is `node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)`. This value is used by the parent node to calculate *its* maximum gain.
3.  **Initial Call:** Call the `max_gain` function with the `root` node.
4.  **Return `max_sum`:** After the recursion completes, `max_sum` will hold the maximum path sum in the entire tree.

Data Structures:

*   Recursion (implicit stack).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(h) in the average case (balanced tree), where h is the height of the tree, and O(n) in the worst-case (completely unbalanced tree) due to the recursive call stack.

Trade-offs:

*   This recursive approach is concise and efficient. The key idea is to consider two types of paths at each node: paths that extend downwards (used for calculating the gain for parent nodes) and paths that potentially peak at the current node (used for updating the global maximum).

## Code

[Recursive Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The problem is tricky because the maximum path might not include the root, and it might involve going "up" and then "down" in the tree.
*   The `max_gain` function cleverly handles both the case where we continue a path from a child node and the case where we start a new path at the current node.
*   Initializing `max_sum` to negative infinity ensures that we correctly handle trees with all negative values.
