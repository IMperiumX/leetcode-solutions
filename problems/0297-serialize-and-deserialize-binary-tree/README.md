# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Approach(es)

### Preorder Traversal with Delimiter

Algorithm:

**Serialization (serialize method):**

1.  **Recursive Preorder Traversal:**
    *   If the current node is `None`, append the string "None" (our delimiter) to the result list.
    *   Otherwise:
        *   Append the string representation of the node's value (`str(node.val)`) to the result list.
        *   Recursively serialize the left subtree.
        *   Recursively serialize the right subtree.
2.  **Join the Result:** Join the elements of the result list into a single string, using a comma (`,`) as a separator.  This creates the serialized string.

**Deserialization (deserialize method):**

1.  **Split the String:** Split the input string by the comma delimiter to get a list of values (strings).
2.  **Create an Iterator:** Create an iterator from this list of strings. This allows us to process the values one by one in the order they appear in the serialized string.
3.  **Recursive Tree Building:**
    *   Define a recursive helper function `build_tree(nodes)`:
        *   Get the next value from the iterator using `next(nodes)`.
        *   If the value is "None", return `None` (we've reached a null node).
        *   Otherwise:
            *   Create a new `TreeNode` with the integer value of the current string.
            *   Recursively build the left subtree by calling `build_tree(nodes)`.
            *   Recursively build the right subtree by calling `build_tree(nodes)`.
            *   Return the newly created node.
    * Call `build_tree` to start the tree.

Data Structures:

*   String (for serialization)
*   List (temporarily during serialization and deserialization)
*   Iterator (during deserialization)

Time Complexity:

*   **Serialization:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
*   **Deserialization:** O(n). We process each value in the serialized string once.

Space Complexity:

*   **Serialization:** O(n) -  The serialized string will have a length proportional to the number of nodes (including "None" delimiters). Also, the recursion uses O(h) space on the call stack, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst-case (skewed tree), h can be equal to n.
*   **Deserialization:** O(n) - The list of strings created by splitting the input string takes O(n) space. The recursion also uses O(h) space on the call stack, which can be O(n) in the worst case.

Trade-offs:
* This approach is relatively easy to implement and is efficient in terms of time complexity. The space complexity is O(n) due to the serialized string and the recursion stack.

[Preorder Traversal with Delimiter](./solution.py)

## Notes

*   This solution uses preorder traversal, but other traversals (inorder, postorder, level-order) could also be used, with appropriate modifications to the deserialization process.
*   The choice of delimiter ("None" in this case) is important. It should be a string that cannot be a valid node value.
*   Using an iterator during deserialization simplifies the process of consuming the values from the serialized string one by one.
* This is a classic tree problem that demonstrates the concepts of recursion, tree traversal, and serialization/deserialization.
* Level order traversal using BFS can be used as alternative approach.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic extraction.
*Analysis:* The relevant topics are "Tree", "Depth-First Search (DFS)", "Breadth-First Search (BFS)" (mentioned as an alternative), "Design", and "String".

```markdown
# Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.  It is a non-linear data structure, unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. A tree is a special case of a graph (a connected, acyclic graph).

## Key Terminology

*   **Root:** The topmost node in the tree.
*   **Node:**  An element in the tree that contains data and may have links to other nodes.
*   **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
*   **Parent:** A node that has a direct connection to another node (its child).
*   **Child:** A node that is directly connected to another node (its parent).
*   **Leaf:** A node with no children.
*   **Subtree:** A portion of the tree that is itself a tree.
*   **Depth (of a node):** The number of edges from the root to the node.
*   **Height (of a tree):** The maximum depth of any node in the tree.
*   **Level:** All nodes at the same depth.

## Types of Trees

*   **Binary Tree:**  Each node has at most two children (left and right).
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree where the value of each node in the left subtree is less than the node's value, and the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than the node's value.
*   **Balanced Tree:** A tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1 (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees). Balanced trees ensure logarithmic time complexity for many operations.
*   **Complete Binary Tree:**  All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
*   **Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree):** Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
*   **Perfect Binary Tree:** All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
*   **N-ary Tree (Generic Tree):**  Each node can have any number of children.

## Tree Traversals

*   **Preorder:**  Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
*   **Inorder:** Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree. (For BSTs, this visits nodes in sorted order).
*   **Postorder:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
*   **Level-order (Breadth-First):** Visit nodes level by level, from left to right.

## Common Tree Operations

*   **Insertion:** Adding a new node to the tree.
*   **Deletion:** Removing a node from the tree.
*   **Search:** Finding a node with a specific value.
*   **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in the tree in a specific order.

# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Algorithm (Recursive)

1.  **Base Case:** If the current node is null (or already visited, in the case of a graph), return.
2.  **Process Node:** Perform the desired operation on the current node (e.g., print its value, mark it as visited).
3.  **Recursive Calls:** Recursively call DFS on each of the node's unvisited children (or neighbors, in the case of a graph).

## Algorithm (Iterative - using a Stack)

1.  Push the starting node onto a stack.
2.  While the stack is not empty:
    *   Pop a node from the stack.
    *   If the node has not been visited:
        *   Process the node (e.g., print its value, mark it as visited).
        *   Push all unvisited children (or neighbors) of the node onto the stack.

## Applications of DFS

*   **Tree Traversals:** Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of trees are forms of DFS.
*   **Graph Traversals:** Finding connected components, cycle detection, topological sorting.
*   **Pathfinding:** Finding a path between two nodes in a graph.
*   **Solving Puzzles:** Many puzzles (e.g., mazes, Sudoku) can be solved using DFS.

## Advantages of DFS

*   **Simple Implementation:** DFS is relatively easy to implement, especially recursively.
*   **Memory Efficiency (sometimes):** In some cases, DFS can be more memory-efficient than Breadth-First Search (BFS), especially for deep, narrow trees or graphs.

## Disadvantages of DFS

*   **Not Guaranteed to Find Shortest Path:** DFS explores depth-first, so it may not find the shortest path between two nodes.
* **Completeness**: It might get stuck in infinite loop, if not implemented correctly.

# Design

The "Design" topic in algorithms and data structures focuses on problems where you're asked to design a data structure or a system that meets specific requirements and constraints. These problems often test your ability to:

*   **Understand Requirements:** Clearly grasp the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
*   **Choose Appropriate Data Structures:** Select the right data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables, heaps, graphs) to efficiently store and manipulate data.
*   **Design Algorithms:** Develop algorithms to perform the required operations on the data structure.
*   **Consider Trade-offs:** Analyze the time and space complexity of your design choices and make trade-offs based on the problem constraints.
*   **Handle Edge Cases:**  Ensure that your design handles all possible input scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
*   **Object-Oriented Principles (often):**  Many design problems are presented in an object-oriented context, requiring you to define classes, interfaces, and relationships between objects.

## Common Types of Design Problems

*   **Data Structure Design:** Design a data structure with specific operations and performance characteristics (e.g., LRU Cache, LFU Cache, Min Stack).
*   **System Design:** Design a larger system, often involving multiple components and interactions (e.g., Design a URL shortener, Design a rate limiter). This type usually appears in system design interviews, rarely in LeetCode.
*   **Algorithm Design within a Data Structure:** Design algorithms to perform specific operations efficiently within a given data structure (e.g., serialize/deserialize a binary tree).

## Tips for Solving Design Problems

1.  **Clarify Requirements:** Ask clarifying questions to fully understand the problem's scope, constraints, and expected behavior.
2.  **Start Simple:** Begin with a simple design and gradually add complexity as needed.
3.  **Break Down the Problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.
4.  **Use Existing Data Structures:** Leverage standard data structures and algorithms whenever possible.
5.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Think about potential edge cases and how your design will handle them.
6.  **Analyze Time and Space Complexity:**  Evaluate the efficiency of your design in terms of time and space.
7.  **Iterate and Refine:**  Be prepared to iterate on your design and improve it based on feedback or further analysis.
8.  **Explain Your Reasoning:** Clearly articulate your design choices and the rationale behind them.
