**Step 4: `README.md` Generation**

# 22. Generate Parentheses, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

**Example 1:**

Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= n <= 8

## Approach(es)

### Backtracking Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Base Case:** If the current string has length `2 * n`, it's a complete combination, so add it to the result list and return.
2.  **Recursive Steps:**
    *   **Add Open Parenthesis:** If the number of open parentheses is less than `n`, we can add an open parenthesis "(" to the current string and recursively call the function with an incremented `open_count`.
    *   **Add Close Parenthesis:** If the number of close parentheses is less than the number of open parentheses, we can add a close parenthesis ")" to the current string and recursively call the function with an incremented `close_count`.  This ensures we only add closing parentheses when there's a corresponding open parenthesis.
3.  Start the backtracking process with an empty string and `open_count` and `close_count` both initialized to 0.

Data Structures:

*   String: We build the parenthesis combinations as strings.
*   List: We store the results in a list.

Time Complexity:

*   O(4<sup>n</sup> / sqrt(n)).  This is related to the Catalan numbers, which describe the number of well-formed parenthesis combinations. The complexity is exponential, but tighter bounds exist.

Space Complexity:

*   O(4<sup>n</sup> / sqrt(n)) for the result list in the worst case, and O(n) for the recursion call stack (depth of recursion).

Trade-offs:
- Backtracking systematically explores all valid combinations, guaranteeing correctness.
- The exponential time complexity is unavoidable for this problem since we must generate all possible valid combinations.

## Notes (Optional)

- This problem is a classic example of backtracking, where we make choices and explore different paths, undoing choices (backtracking) when necessary.
- The key constraint for well-formed parentheses is that at any point, the number of closing parentheses must not exceed the number of open parentheses.

# Backtracking

## Explanation

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Choice:** At each step, there are multiple choices to make.
*   **Constraint:** Rules that limit the valid choices.
*   **Goal:**  A state that satisfies all constraints and represents a solution.

**General Algorithm:**

```
def backtrack(candidate):
    if is_solution(candidate):
        add_to_result(candidate)
        return

    for choice in get_choices(candidate):
        if is_valid(candidate, choice):
            make_choice(candidate, choice)  # Modify the candidate
            backtrack(candidate)
            undo_choice(candidate, choice)  # Backtrack: undo the modification
```

**Explanation of Steps:**

1.  **`backtrack(candidate)`:** The recursive function that explores possible solutions.
2.  **`is_solution(candidate)`:** Checks if the current `candidate` is a complete solution.
3.  **`add_to_result(candidate)`:** Adds the complete solution to the result set.
4.  **`get_choices(candidate)`:** Returns a list of possible choices at the current state.
5.  **`is_valid(candidate, choice)`:** Checks if making the given `choice` is allowed by the problem's constraints.
6.  **`make_choice(candidate, choice)`:**  Applies the `choice` to the `candidate` (e.g., adding an element, making a move).
7.  **`undo_choice(candidate, choice)`:** Reverts the `choice` (e.g., removing the element, undoing the move).  This is crucial for exploring other possibilities.

**Advantages:**

*   **Systematic Exploration:** Guarantees finding all solutions (if they exist) by systematically exploring the search space.
*   **Flexibility:** Can be adapted to a wide variety of problems.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Exponential Time Complexity:** In the worst case, backtracking can explore a very large search space, leading to exponential time complexity.  However, effective pruning (using constraints to eliminate choices early) can significantly improve performance.

**Common Applications:**

*   **N-Queens Problem:** Placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
*   **Sudoku Solver:** Filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
*   **Maze Solving:** Finding a path through a maze.
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:**  Problems involving finding the best combination of choices, such as the Knapsack problem.
* **Generate Parentheses.**
*   **Permutations and Combinations:** Generating all possible permutations or combinations of a set of elements.

# Recursion

## Explanation

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition.  It's a powerful way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Base Case(s):**  One or more conditions that stop the recursion.  Without base cases, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
2.  **Recursive Step:** The part of the function where it calls itself, usually with modified input that brings it closer to a base case.

**How it Works:**

Each time a function calls itself, a new "frame" is added to the call stack.  This frame stores the function's local variables and the point to return to after the recursive call completes. When a base case is reached, the function returns a value, and the frames are popped off the stack one by one, with each return value potentially being used in the calling function.

**Example: Factorial**

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive step: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

**Advantages:**

*   **Elegance and Readability:** Recursive solutions can often be more concise and easier to understand than iterative solutions for problems with a naturally recursive structure.
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Recursion naturally breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Stack Overflow:**  Excessive recursion (too many nested calls) can lead to a stack overflow error if the call stack runs out of space.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Function calls can have some overhead, so recursive solutions can sometimes be slower than iterative solutions, especially if the recursion depth is large.  However, tail-call optimization (available in some languages) can mitigate this.
*   **Debugging:**  Debugging recursive functions can sometimes be more challenging than debugging iterative code.

**Types of Recursion:**

*   **Direct Recursion:** A function calls itself directly.
*   **Indirect Recursion:**  A function calls another function, which eventually calls the first function (forming a cycle).
*   **Tail Recursion:**  The recursive call is the very last operation performed in the function.  Tail-recursive functions can often be optimized by compilers to avoid stack growth.
*   **Non-Tail Recursion:** The recursive call is not the last operation (e.g., there's a calculation after the recursive call).

**Common Applications:**

*   **Tree Traversal:** (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
*   **Graph Traversal:** (Depth-First Search)
*   **Divide and Conquer Algorithms:** (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
*   **Fractals:** Generating self-similar patterns.
*   **Mathematical Functions:** (Factorial, Fibonacci sequence)
* **Backtracking.**

# String Manipulation

## Explanation
String manipulation refers to the various operations that can be performed on strings, which are sequences of characters. These operations include modifying, analyzing, and extracting information from strings. String manipulation is a fundamental aspect of many programming tasks, particularly in areas like text processing, data parsing, and web development.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
*   **Slicing:** Extracting a portion (substring) of a string.
*   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a specific character or substring within a string.
*   **Replacing:** Substituting parts of a string with other characters or substrings.
*   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
*   **Joining:** Combining a list of strings into a single string, using a specified separator.
*   **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of characters (uppercase, lowercase).
*   **Trimming:** Removing leading and trailing whitespace (or other specified characters).
*   **Length Calculation:** Determining the number of characters in a string.
*   **Formatting:** Creating strings with specific formatting, such as inserting values into placeholders.
*  **Character Access:** Access individual characters within string using indexing.
