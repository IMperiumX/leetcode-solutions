## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the *i*th day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

**Example 1:**

Input: `temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`
Output: `[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `temperatures = [30,40,50,60]`
Output: `[1,1,1,0]`

**Example 3:**

Input: `temperatures = [30,60,90]`
Output: `[1,1,0]`

Constraints:

*   `1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5`
*   `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`

## Approach(es)

### Monotonic Stack Approach

The most efficient approach uses a Monotonic Decreasing Stack.  A monotonic stack is a stack where the elements are either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. In this case, we maintain a stack of indices such that the temperatures corresponding to those indices are in decreasing order.

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialize:** Create an `answer` list of the same length as `temperatures`, initialized with zeros. Also, initialize an empty stack `stack` to store indices.
2.  **Iterate:** Loop through the `temperatures` list with its index `i` and temperature `temp`.
3.  **Stack Comparison:** While the `stack` is not empty AND the temperature at the index at the top of the stack (`temperatures[stack[-1]]`) is less than the current temperature `temp`:
    *   Pop the index (`prev_index`) from the `stack`.
    *   Calculate the waiting days: `answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index`.
4.  **Push to Stack:** Push the current index `i` onto the `stack`.
5.  **Return:** After iterating through all temperatures, return the `answer` list.

Data Structures:

*   `answer`: A list to store the results.
*   `stack`: A monotonic decreasing stack to store indices of temperatures.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N), where N is the length of the `temperatures` array.  Each element is pushed onto the stack and popped at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(N) in the worst case, where the stack might store all indices if the temperatures are in strictly decreasing order.  On average, the space complexity is less than O(N).

Trade-offs:

*   This approach offers optimal time complexity.
*   It uses extra space for the stack, but the space complexity is still linear.

### Brute Force Approach

A brute force approach involves checking each day against all subsequent days to find the next warmer day.

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialize:** Create an `answer` list of the same length as `temperatures`, initialized with zeros.
2.  **Outer Loop:** Iterate through `temperatures` with index `i`.
3.  **Inner Loop:** For each `i`, iterate through the remaining days (from `i + 1` to the end).
4.  **Comparison:** If a warmer temperature is found at index `j`, calculate `answer[i] = j - i` and break the inner loop.
5.  **Return:**  Return the `answer` list.

Data Structures:

*    `answer`: List of result.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N^2), where N is the length of `temperatures`. The nested loops lead to quadratic time complexity.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

Trade-offs:

*   Easy to understand.
* Very Inefficient.

## Notes
The Monotonic Stack approach is significantly more efficient than the brute force approach for larger input sizes.  Understanding monotonic stacks is crucial for solving similar problems involving finding the next greater/smaller element.

**Step 5: Topics Extraction**

Create files for `Arrays.md` and `Stack.md`.

```markdown
Arrays.md:
# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures that store collections of elements, each identified by an index or a key. They are widely used in programming for organizing and manipulating data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Elements:** The individual items stored in an array.
- **Index:** The position of an element within the array, typically starting from 0 (zero-based indexing).
- **Fixed Size:** In many languages (like C++, Java), arrays have a fixed size determined at compile time.  Python lists, however, are dynamic arrays.
- **Contiguous Memory:** Array elements are usually stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access.
- **Random Access:** Elements can be accessed directly using their index (e.g., `arr[3]`).
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays can have multiple dimensions (e.g., 2D arrays for representing matrices or grids).

## Common Operations

- **Access:** Retrieving an element at a specific index.
- **Insertion:** Adding a new element (dynamic arrays support this more easily than fixed-size arrays).
- **Deletion:** Removing an element.
- **Search:** Finding a specific element within the array.
- **Iteration:** Looping through all elements of the array.
- **Update/Modification:** Changing the value of an element at a specific index.

## Types of Arrays

- **Static Arrays:** Fixed-size arrays.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** Arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed (e.g., Python lists, C++ `std::vector`).
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays with more than one dimension.

## Advantages

- **Efficient Access:**  O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index.
- **Simple Implementation:** Arrays are relatively easy to understand and implement.
- **Foundation for Other Data Structures:** Many other data structures are built upon arrays (e.g., stacks, queues, heaps).

## Disadvantages

- **Fixed Size (Static Arrays):**  Resizing can be expensive (requiring copying all elements to a new array).
- **Insertion/Deletion (Middle):** Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array can be inefficient (O(n) time complexity) because it may require shifting other elements.

## Use Cases

- Storing and accessing sequences of data.
- Representing matrices and grids.
- Implementing other data structures.
- Buffers and caches.

Stack.md:

# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.  This means that the last element added to the stack is the first element removed.  Think of a stack of plates: you add new plates to the top, and you also remove plates from the top.

## Key Concepts

- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):**  The most recently added element is the first one to be removed.
- **Push:**  Adding an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removing the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek/Top:**  Viewing the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
- **isFull:**  Checking if the stack is full (relevant for fixed-size stack implementations).

## Common Operations

- **push(element):** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **pop():** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
- **peek()/top():** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
- **isEmpty():** Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
- **isFull():** Returns `True` if the stack is full, `False` otherwise (only applicable to fixed-size implementations).
- **size():** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Implementations

Stacks can be implemented using:

- **Arrays:** A fixed-size array can be used to implement a stack.  An index variable keeps track of the top of the stack.
- **Linked Lists:** A linked list can be used to implement a dynamic stack.  Each node in the linked list represents an element in the stack, and the "top" pointer points to the most recently added node.

## Advantages

- **Simple and Efficient:** Stack operations (push, pop, peek) are typically very fast (O(1) time complexity).
- **Controlled Access:**  The LIFO principle provides a controlled way to access data.
- **Memory Management:** Stacks are used in function call management (the call stack) and in some memory allocation schemes.

## Disadvantages

- **Limited Access:** Only the top element is directly accessible.
- **Fixed Size (Array Implementation):**  Array-based stacks have a fixed capacity.

## Use Cases

- **Function Call Stack:**  Managing function calls and local variables.
- **Expression Evaluation:**  Evaluating arithmetic expressions (e.g., using the shunting yard algorithm).
- **Undo/Redo Functionality:**  Implementing undo and redo operations in applications.
- **Backtracking Algorithms:**  Exploring different possibilities in algorithms like Depth-First Search.
- **Browser History:**  Storing the history of visited web pages.
- **Monotonic Stack:** a variant useful for next greater/smaller elements problems.
