# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example 1:

Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]

Example 2:

Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]

Constraints:

m == heights.length
n == heights[r].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Approach(es)

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create two boolean matrices, `pacific_reachable` and `atlantic_reachable`, of the same size as `heights`, initialized to `False`.  These matrices will track which cells can reach each ocean.
2.  **DFS Function (`dfs`):**
    *   Takes the current cell's row and column, and the `reachable` matrix (either `pacific_reachable` or `atlantic_reachable`) as input.
    *   Marks the current cell as reachable (`reachable[row][col] = True`).
    *   Iterates through the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
    *   For each neighbor:
        *   Check if the neighbor is within the grid bounds.
        *   Check if the neighbor has *not* already been visited (to avoid cycles).
        *   Check if the water can flow from the current cell to the neighbor (neighbor's height is greater than or equal to the current cell's height).
        *   If all conditions are met, recursively call `dfs` on the neighbor.
3.  **DFS from Pacific Ocean:**
    *   Perform DFS from all cells on the top and left edges of the grid, using the `pacific_reachable` matrix.
4.  **DFS from Atlantic Ocean:**
    *   Perform DFS from all cells on the bottom and right edges of the grid, using the `atlantic_reachable` matrix.
5.  **Find Common Reachable Cells:** Iterate through all cells in the grid. If a cell is reachable from both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (i.e., both `pacific_reachable[i][j]` and `atlantic_reachable[i][j]` are `True`), add its coordinates `[i, j]` to the result list.
6.  **Return Result:** Return the list of coordinates.

Data Structures:

*   Two boolean matrices (`pacific_reachable` and `atlantic_reachable`) to store reachability information.
*   A list to store the result coordinates.

Time Complexity:

*   O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Each cell is visited at most a constant number of times (during the two DFS traversals).

Space Complexity:

*   O(m * n) -  The `pacific_reachable` and `atlantic_reachable` matrices take O(m * n) space. The recursion depth for DFS can also go up to O(m * n) in the worst case (although this is less of a concern than the matrices themselves).

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is relatively straightforward to implement using DFS. It systematically explores the reachability from each ocean. The main trade-off is the space used by the reachability matrices.  We *could* try to modify the input `heights` matrix in-place to save space, but that would modify the original input, which is generally not desirable.

# Breadth-First Search

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph (or tree) level by level. It starts at a source node and visits all its immediate neighbors, then visits their unvisited neighbors, and so on. This continues until all reachable nodes have been visited. BFS is often used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

## Key Concepts

*   **Traversal:** Visiting all reachable nodes in a graph.
*   **Queue:** BFS uses a queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out) data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit.
*   **Visited Set:** A set (or other data structure) to keep track of visited nodes, preventing cycles and redundant visits.
*   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph in layers, starting with the source node's immediate neighbors (level 1), then their neighbors (level 2), and so on.

## Algorithm

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start_node):
    """
    Performs a breadth-first search on a graph.

    Args:
        graph: The graph represented as an adjacency list (dictionary).
        start_node: The starting node for the search.

    Returns:
        A list of visited nodes in the order they were visited.
    """
    visited = set()  # Keep track of visited nodes.
    queue = deque([start_node])  # Initialize the queue with the starting node.
    visited_order = [] # keep track of the visiting order

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.

        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            visited_order.append(node)
            #print(node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it).

            # Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the current node.
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    return visited_order
```

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty queue `queue`.
    *   Create an empty set `visited` to track visited nodes.
    *   Enqueue the `start_node` into the `queue`.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the `queue` is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node from the front of the `queue`.
        *   If the node has not been visited:
            *   Mark the node as visited (add it to the `visited` set).
            *   Process the node (e.g., print its value, add it to a result list).
            *   Enqueue all *unvisited* neighbors of the node into the `queue`.

## Use Cases

BFS is commonly used for:

*   **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs:** Finding the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
*   **Level Order Traversal of Trees:** Visiting all nodes of a tree level by level.
*   **Connectivity Check:** Determining if a graph is connected.
*   **Finding Connected Components:** Identifying all connected components in a graph.
*   **Web Crawling:**  Crawling web pages, starting from a seed URL and exploring links.
*   **Social Networks:**  Finding friends of friends (at a certain distance).
* **Solving puzzles** (e.g., finding the minimum number of moves to reach a target state).

## Advantages

*   **Finds Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):**  BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
*   **Complete:**  BFS is guaranteed to find a path to a target node if one exists.
* **Simple Implementation:**

## Disadvantages

*   **Memory Usage:**  BFS can use more memory than DFS in some cases, especially for wide graphs (graphs with many nodes at each level).  The queue can potentially store a large number of nodes.
*   **Not Ideal for Deep Graphs:** For very deep graphs, DFS might be more memory-efficient (as it explores depth-first).

# Matrix

A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental in linear algebra and have numerous applications in computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering. In the context of algorithms and LeetCode problems, a matrix is typically represented as a 2D array (a list of lists in Python).

## Key Concepts

*   **Dimensions:** A matrix has `m` rows and `n` columns, denoted as an `m x n` matrix.
*   **Elements:** The individual values in the matrix.  `matrix[i][j]` refers to the element at row `i` and column `j` (0-indexed).
*   **Square Matrix:** A matrix with the same number of rows and columns (m = n).
*   **Row:** A horizontal line of elements.
*   **Column:** A vertical line of elements.
*   **Diagonal:** The elements from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonal) or from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonal).
*   **Transpose:** A new matrix formed by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix.
* **Identity Matrix:** is a square matrix that has 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere.

## Common Operations

*   **Access:** Retrieving the value of an element at a specific row and column: `matrix[i][j]`. Time complexity: O(1).
*   **Traversal:** Iterating through all elements of the matrix:
    *   Row-major order: Visit all elements in the first row, then the second row, and so on.
    *   Column-major order: Visit all elements in the first column, then the second column, and so on.
*   **Search:** Finding a specific value within the matrix. Time complexity: O(m*n) for a general search, but can be optimized for sorted matrices.
*   **Modification:** Changing the value of an element at a specific row and column: `matrix[i][j] = new_value`. Time complexity: O(1).
*   **Transpose:** Creating the transpose of the matrix. Time complexity: O(m*n).
*   **Matrix Addition/Subtraction:** Adding or subtracting two matrices of the same dimensions. Time complexity: O(m*n).
*   **Matrix Multiplication:** Multiplying two matrices (where the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix
