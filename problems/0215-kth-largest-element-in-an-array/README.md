# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the *k*th largest element in the array.

Note that it is the *k*th largest element in the sorted order, not the *k*th distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
*   -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Approach(es)

### QuickSelect Approach

**Algorithm:**

QuickSelect is an algorithm to find the *k*th smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list.  It's related to the QuickSort algorithm.

1.  **Choose a Pivot:**  Select a pivot element (randomly is best for average-case performance).
2.  **Partition:**  Partition the array around the pivot.  Elements smaller than the pivot go to the left, and elements larger than the pivot go to the right.
3.  **Recurse:**
    *   If the pivot's index is the *k*th smallest index (which is `len(nums) - k` for the *k*th largest), we've found the answer.
    *   If the pivot's index is *less than* the *k*th smallest index, recursively search the *right* subarray.
    *   If the pivot's index is *greater than* the *k*th smallest index, recursively search the *left* subarray.

**Data Structures:**

*   The algorithm operates in-place on the input array.

**Time Complexity:**

*   **Average Case:** O(N) - On average, the partitioning step divides the problem roughly in half.
*   **Worst Case:** O(N^2) -  This can happen if we consistently pick bad pivots (e.g., the smallest or largest element).  Randomized pivot selection helps mitigate this.
*   **Best Case:** O(N)

**Space Complexity:**

*   **Average Case:** O(log N) - Due to the recursive call stack.
*   **Worst Case:** O(N) - In the worst-case scenario of a highly unbalanced recursion tree.

**Trade-offs:**

*   QuickSelect is generally the most efficient approach for this problem, especially on average.
*   The worst-case time complexity can be a concern, but randomized pivot selection makes it very unlikely.

### Min-Heap Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Build a Min-Heap:**  Iterate through the array and add elements to a min-heap.
2.  **Maintain Heap Size:**  If the heap's size exceeds *k*, remove the smallest element (the root of the min-heap).
3.  **Result:** After processing all elements, the root of the min-heap will be the *k*th largest element.

**Data Structures:**

*   Min-Heap: Used to efficiently track the *k* largest elements seen so far.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N log k) - Building the heap takes O(N) insertions, each with a cost of O(log k) (since the heap size is limited to *k*).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(k) - The heap stores at most *k* elements.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is very concise and easy to implement using Python's `heapq` module.
*   It's less efficient than QuickSelect on average, but its worst-case performance is better.

### Sorting Approach

**Algorithm:**

1. Sort the Array
2. return Kth element from the end.

**Data Structures:**

*   The algorithm operates in-place on the input array (depending on the specific sorting method)

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N log N) , Where N is number of element in the array.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) or O(log N) or O(N) depend on the sorting algorithm.

**Trade-offs:**

*   Easy to understand and implement.
*   Not Optimal

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*   **Array:**  The problem operates on an array.
*   **Sorting:** One solution involves sorting and the QuickSelect algorithm is related to QuickSort.
*   **Heap (Priority Queue):**  One solution uses a min-heap.
*   **Divide and Conquer:** QuickSelect is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.

**Array.md:**

```markdown
# Array

An array is a fundamental data structure in computer science that stores a collection of elements of the same data type.  Elements are accessed using an index (usually starting from 0).

**Key Properties:**

*   **Contiguous Memory:**  Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient access.
*   **Fixed Size (in most languages):** The size of an array is typically fixed at the time of creation (though dynamic arrays/lists exist in some languages, like Python).
*   **Random Access:**  Elements can be accessed directly using their index in O(1) time.

**Advantages:**

*   **Fast Access:** O(1) access time for any element.
*   **Simple to Use:** Arrays are easy to understand and implement.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Fixed Size:**  Resizing an array can be expensive (requires creating a new array and copying elements).
*   **Insertion/Deletion:**  Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array can be inefficient (requires shifting elements).

**Sorting.md:**

# Sorting
Sorting is one of the fundamental operations in computer science. Sorting algorithms arrange the elements of a list or array in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. There are many sorting algorithms available that have different trade-offs.

**Key Properties:**

*   **In Place:** Sorts the data within input array.
*   **Out Place:** Sorts the data by using another data structure.
*   **Stable:** Does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.
*   **Unstable:** Might change the relative order of elements with equal keys.

**Heap.md:**

```markdown
# Heap (Priority Queue)

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.  Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.

**Heap Property:**

*   **Min-Heap:**  For every node, the value of the node is less than or equal to the value of its children.  The smallest element is always at the root.
*   **Max-Heap:** For every node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the value of its children.  The largest element is always at the root.

**Common Heap Operations:**

*   **insert(item):** Adds an item to the heap, maintaining the heap property.
*   **deleteMin() / deleteMax():** Removes and returns the smallest/largest element (the root), maintaining the heap property.
*   **findMin() / findMax():** Returns the smallest/largest element without removing it.
*   **heapify(list):**  Transforms a list into a heap (in-place).

**Implementation:**

Heaps are typically implemented using arrays. The relationship between parent and child nodes is determined by their indices:

*   Left child of node at index `i`: `2i + 1`
*   Right child of node at index `i`: `2i + 2`
*   Parent of node at index `i`: `(i - 1) // 2`

**Advantages:**

*   **Efficient Retrieval of Extremes:**  Finding the minimum (or maximum) element is O(1).
*   **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:**  Insertion and deletion of the root element are O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the heap.

**Applications:**

*   **Priority Queues:**  Heaps are the natural implementation for priority queues.
*   **Heap Sort:** A sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure.
*   **Graph Algorithms:**  Heaps are used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.

**Divide and Conquer.md:**

```markdown
# Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by recursively breaking it down into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Divide:** Break the problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
2.  **Conquer:** Solve the subproblems recursively. If the subproblems are small enough, solve them directly (base case).
3.  **Combine:** Combine the solutions to the subproblems to obtain the solution to the original problem.

**Examples of Divide and Conquer Algorithms:**

*   **Merge Sort:**  Divides the array into halves, sorts the halves recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.
*   **Quick Sort:**  Chooses a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and then recursively sorts the subarrays.
*   **Binary Search:**  Searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
*   **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication:** A faster algorithm for matrix multiplication.

**Advantages:**

*   **Efficiency:**  Divide and conquer algorithms often lead to more efficient solutions (e.g., O(N log N) for sorting).
*   **Parallelism:**  Subproblems can often be solved independently, making divide and conquer algorithms suitable for parallel processing.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Recursion Overhead:**  Recursive calls can have some overhead.
*   **Complexity:**  Divide and conquer algorithms can sometimes be more complex to design and implement than simpler iterative solutions.
