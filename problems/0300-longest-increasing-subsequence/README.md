Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for "Longest Increasing Subsequence" (Problem 300).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `300. Longest Increasing Subsequence ... [problem description]`."
*   **Output:** "Problem Number: 300, Problem Name: Longest Increasing Subsequence, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0300-longest-increasing-subsequence`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

We'll generate two solutions: one using dynamic programming (O(n^2)) and another using patience sorting with binary search (O(n log n)).

*   **Prompt 3.2:** "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Longest Increasing Subsequence` (Number: `300`). ... Create files named `solution_dp.py` and `solution_patience.py`."

*   Create `solution_dp.py`:

```python
# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence - Dynamic Programming (O(n^2))

def lengthOfLIS_dp(nums):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence using dynamic programming.

    Args:
        nums: The input list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n  # dp[i] stores the length of the LIS ending at index i.

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)
```

*   Create `solution_patience.py`:

```python
# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence - Patience Sorting with Binary Search (O(n log n))
import bisect

def lengthOfLIS_patience(nums):
    """
    Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence using patience sorting and binary search.

    Args:
        nums: The input list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not nums:
      return 0

    tails = []  # tails[i] is the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length i+1.

    for num in nums:
        # If we find a number in `tails` that is greater than or equal to the current number (using binary search)
        # we replace that number with the current number. This maintains the property that `tails` is always sorted.
        # bisect_left returns the insertion point to maintain sorted order.
        i = bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)

        if i == len(tails):
            # If the current number is greater than all numbers in `tails`, it extends the longest increasing subsequence.
            tails.append(num)
        else:
            # Otherwise, replace the element at the insertion point.
            tails[i] = num
    return len(tails)
```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file for the problem: `Longest Increasing Subsequence` (Number: `300`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

```markdown
# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?

## Approach(es)

### Dynamic Programming (O(n^2))

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:** Create a `dp` array of the same length as `nums`, initialized with all elements set to 1.  `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence *ending* at index `i`.  Since a single element itself forms an increasing subsequence of length 1, we initialize all `dp[i]` to 1.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the `nums` array from left to right (outer loop with index `i`).
    *   For each element `nums[i]`, iterate through all *previous* elements (inner loop with index `j` from 0 to `i-1`).
    *   If `nums[i] > nums[j]` (meaning we can extend a previous increasing subsequence), update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.  This step is crucial: we're checking if adding `nums[i]` to the subsequence ending at `nums[j]` creates a longer increasing subsequence.
3.  **Result:** After iterating through all elements, the maximum value in the `dp` array is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire `nums` array.

Data Structures:

*   `dp` array (list) of length n.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n^2) - Due to the nested loops.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - For the `dp` array.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is relatively easy to understand and implement.
*   The O(n^2) time complexity is not optimal for large input sizes.

### Patience Sorting with Binary Search (O(n log n))

Algorithm:

This approach is based on the idea of "patience sorting." Imagine dealing cards one by one.  We maintain several piles of cards, where each pile is sorted in increasing order from top to bottom.  When we deal a new card:

1.  If the card is greater than the top card of all existing piles, we start a new pile to the right.
2.  Otherwise, we find the *leftmost* pile where the top card is greater than or equal to the current card, and we place the current card on top of that pile (replacing the previous top card).

The number of piles at the end represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

To implement this efficiently, we don't need to store the entire piles. We only need to store the top card of each pile.  We use a list called `tails` where `tails[i]` is the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of length `i+1`.

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty list called `tails`.
2. **Iteration**: Iterate through each number `num` in `nums`.
   * **Binary Search:** Use `bisect_left(tails, num)` to find the index `i` where `num` should be inserted into `tails` to maintain its sorted order.
     * If `i == len(tails)`, this means `num` is greater than all elements in `tails`, so we append `num` to `tails` (extending the longest increasing subsequence).
     * Otherwise, we replace `tails[i]` with `num`. This is because `num` is smaller than the previous tail of a subsequence of the same length.
3. **Result:** Return the length of tails, which is the length of the LIS.

Data Structures:

*   `tails` list.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n) -  The outer loop iterates n times.  Inside the loop, `bisect_left` takes O(log n) time.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - In the worst case, the `tails` list can have a size of n (e.g., if the input array is strictly increasing).  On average, it will be smaller.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is more efficient than the DP approach (O(n log n) vs. O(n^2)).
*   It's slightly more complex to understand the intuition behind patience sorting and why it works. The use of binary search is key to the improved time complexity.
