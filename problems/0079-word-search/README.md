Okay, let's break down this LeetCode problem and generate the requested files and structure.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid. ... Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB" Output: false`."

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file for the problem: `Word Search` (Number: `79`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

```markdown
# 79. Word Search, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an m x n grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 1:**

Input: `board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]`, `word = "ABCCED"`
Output: `true`

**Example 2:**

Input: `board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]`, `word = "SEE"`
Output: `true`

**Example 3:**

Input: `board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]`, `word = "ABCB"`
Output: `false`

Constraints:

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n = board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 6`
*   `1 <= word.length <= 15`
*   `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Approach(es)

### Backtracking/DFS Approach

The core idea is to explore the grid using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or backtracking approach.  We start at each cell in the grid and try to build the target word by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).  We keep track of the current index in the word we're trying to match.  If we find a cell that matches the current character in the word, we recursively explore its neighbors.  We also need to mark visited cells to avoid cycles and ensure that we don't use the same cell twice.

Algorithm:

1.  **Iterate:** Loop through each cell in the `board` as a potential starting point.
2.  **Backtrack/DFS Function:**  For each starting cell, call a recursive function `backtrack(row, col, word_index)` (or `dfs`).
    *   **Base Case (Success):** If `word_index` is equal to the length of the `word`, it means we've found the entire word, so return `True`.
    *   **Base Case (Failure):** If the current `row` or `col` is out of bounds, or the character at `board[row][col]` does not match `word[word_index]`, return `False`.
    *   **Mark Visited:**  Temporarily mark the current cell as visited.  A common technique is to change the cell's value to a special character (e.g., '#') that won't appear in the input.
    *   **Recursive Calls:** Recursively call `backtrack` for the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), incrementing `word_index` by 1.
    *   **Backtrack (Unmark):** After exploring the neighbors, restore the original character in the cell (unmark it) to allow other paths to potentially use this cell.
    *   **Return Result:** Return `True` if any of the recursive calls return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.
3.  **Return `False`:** If the outer loop completes without finding the word, return `False`.

Data Structures:

*   The input `board` (2D array) is used directly.
*   No extra data structures are needed beyond the call stack for the recursion.

Time Complexity:

*   O(M \* N \* 4^L), where M is the number of rows, N is the number of columns, and L is the length of the word.  In the worst case, we might explore all possible paths of length L starting from each cell. The 4 comes from the four directions we can explore at each step.

Space Complexity:

*   O(L), where L is the length of the word. This is due to the recursive call stack, which can go as deep as the length of the word in the worst case.  The modification of the `board` is in-place, so it doesn't contribute to extra space complexity.

Trade-offs:

*   The backtracking approach is relatively straightforward to implement.
*   The time complexity can be high for longer words and larger boards, but it's generally efficient for the given constraints (m, n <= 6, word.length <= 15).

[DFS Approach](./solution_dfs.py)

## Notes

*   The key optimization is marking visited cells to avoid cycles and redundant explorations.
*   The backtracking/DFS approach is a standard technique for solving search problems on grids.
* This solution directly modifies the input board.  If the original board needs to be preserved, create a copy before calling the `exist` function.

**Step 5: Topics Extraction**

Arrays.md:
# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures that store collections of elements, each identified by an index or a key. They are widely used in programming for organizing and manipulating data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Elements:** The individual items stored in an array.
- **Index:** The position of an element within the array, typically starting from 0 (zero-based indexing).
- **Fixed Size:** In many languages (like C++, Java), arrays have a fixed size determined at compile time.  Python lists, however, are dynamic arrays.
- **Contiguous Memory:** Array elements are usually stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access.
- **Random Access:** Elements can be accessed directly using their index (e.g., `arr[3]`).
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays can have multiple dimensions (e.g., 2D arrays for representing matrices or grids).

## Common Operations

- **Access:** Retrieving an element at a specific index.
- **Insertion:** Adding a new element (dynamic arrays support this more easily than fixed-size arrays).
- **Deletion:** Removing an element.
- **Search:** Finding a specific element within the array.
- **Iteration:** Looping through all elements of the array.
- **Update/Modification:** Changing the value of an element at a specific index.

## Types of Arrays

- **Static Arrays:** Fixed-size arrays.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** Arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed (e.g., Python lists, C++ `std::vector`).
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays with more than one dimension.

## Advantages

- **Efficient Access:**  O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index.
- **Simple Implementation:** Arrays are relatively easy to understand and implement.
- **Foundation for Other Data Structures:** Many other data structures are built upon arrays (e.g., stacks, queues, heaps).

## Disadvantages

- **Fixed Size (Static Arrays):**  Resizing can be expensive (requiring copying all elements to a new array).
- **Insertion/Deletion (Middle):** Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array can be inefficient (O(n) time complexity) because it may require shifting other elements.

## Use Cases

- Storing and accessing sequences of data.
- Representing matrices and grids.
- Implementing other data structures.
- Buffers and caches.

Backtracking.md:
# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to a computational problem, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

## Key Concepts

- **Incremental Construction:** Solutions are built step-by-step.
- **Constraints:** Rules that define valid solutions.
- **Candidate Solutions:** Partial solutions that are being explored.
- **Abandonment:**  Discarding a candidate solution when it violates a constraint.
- **Recursion:** Backtracking is often implemented recursively.
- **State Space Tree:** The set of all possible candidate solutions can be visualized as a tree.

## How Backtracking Works

1.  **Start:** Begin with an empty or initial candidate solution.
2.  **Extend:**  Try to extend the current candidate solution by adding a new element or making a choice.
3.  **Check Constraints:** Verify if the extended candidate solution still satisfies all constraints.
4.  **Success:** If the extended candidate solution is a complete and valid solution, record it (or process it).
5.  **Backtrack:** If the extended candidate solution violates a constraint, or if all possible extensions have been tried, "backtrack" by undoing the last extension and trying a different option.
6.  **Repeat:**  Continue this process until all possible candidate solutions have been explored.

## Example: N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic example of backtracking.  The goal is to place N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other (no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

## Advantages

- **Systematic Exploration:** Guarantees to find all solutions if they exist.
- **Handles Constraints:**  Effectively deals with problems that have complex constraints.
- **Relatively Simple Implementation:**  Often implemented using recursion, which can be concise.

## Disadvantages

- **Exponential Time Complexity (Worst Case):**  In the worst case, backtracking might explore a very large number of candidate solutions.
- **Memory Usage (Call Stack):** Deep recursion can lead to high memory usage due to the call stack.

## Optimization Techniques

- **Pruning:**  Improving efficiency by identifying and discarding infeasible candidate solutions early.
- **Constraint Propagation:**  Using constraints to reduce the search space.
- **Heuristics:**  Using rules of thumb to guide the search towards promising solutions.
- **Memoization/Dynamic Programming:** Storing solutions subproblems to avoid recalculation.

## Use Cases

- Combinatorial problems (e.g., permutations, combinations, subsets).
- Constraint satisfaction problems (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens).
- Graph algorithms (e.g., finding paths, cycles).
- Game playing (e.g., chess, checkers).

Depth-First Search.md:
# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Key Concepts

- **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a tree or graph.
- **Exploration:**  Following a path as deeply as possible before exploring other paths.
- **Backtracking:**  Returning to a previous node to explore unexplored branches.
- **Stack (or Recursion):**  DFS is typically implemented using a stack (explicitly or implicitly via recursion).
- **Visited Set:**  Used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles (especially in graphs).

## How DFS Works (Recursive Implementation)

1.  **Start:** Begin at the root (or a chosen starting node).
2.  **Mark Visited:** Mark the current node as visited.
3.  **Explore Neighbors:** For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
4.  **Backtrack:**  Once all neighbors have been explored, return to the previous node (this happens automatically with recursion).

## How DFS Works (Iterative Implementation - Using a Stack)

1.  **Start:** Push the root (or starting node) onto a stack.
2.  **Loop:** While the stack is not empty:
    *   **Pop:** Pop a node from the stack.
    *   **Mark Visited:**  If the node has not been visited:
        *   Mark it as visited.
        *   **Push Neighbors:** Push all unvisited neighbors of the popped node onto the stack.

## Advantages

- **Simple Implementation:** Can be implemented concisely using recursion.
- **Memory Efficient (Sometimes):** For trees, DFS can be more memory-efficient than Breadth-First Search (BFS) if the tree is very wide but not very deep.
- **Finds Paths:** Useful for finding paths between nodes.

## Disadvantages

- **Not Guaranteed Shortest Path:**  DFS does not necessarily find the shortest path between two nodes (BFS is better for that).
- **Can Get Stuck in Deep Branches:**  In very deep trees or graphs, DFS might explore a very long path before finding a solution.
- **Stack Overflow (Recursion):**  Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.

## Use Cases

- Traversing trees and graphs.
- Finding connected components in a graph.
- Topological sorting.
- Detecting cycles in a graph.
- Solving puzzles (e.g., mazes).
