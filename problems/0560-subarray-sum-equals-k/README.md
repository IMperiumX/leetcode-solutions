Okay, let's create the LeetCode solution repository for "Subarray Sum Equals K" (Problem 560).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `560. Subarray Sum Equals K ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Response:** "Problem Number: 560, Problem Name: Subarray Sum Equals K, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0560-subarray-sum-equals-k`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   Since the user didn't provide a solution, we'll generate one. The most efficient approach uses a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store cumulative sums and their frequencies.  A brute-force approach is possible but highly inefficient.

*   **Prompt 3.2:** "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Subarray Sum Equals K` (Number: `560`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`."
    "If you know of multiple common approaches to solve the problem, generate separate solution files for each approach (e.g., `solution_hashmap.py`, `solution_bruteforce.py`)."

*   We will create `solution_hashmap.py` and `solution_bruteforce.py` inside the problem directory.

    *   **`solution_hashmap.py`**

# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-107 <= k <= 107

## Approach(es)

### Hash Map Approach
- **Algorithm:**
  - Initialize a dictionary `sum_freq` to store cumulative sums and their frequencies. Start with `{0: 1}` to handle subarrays starting from the beginning of the array.
  - Initialize `cumulative_sum` to 0 and `count` (the result) to 0.
  - Iterate through the array:
    - Update `cumulative_sum` by adding the current element.
    - Check if `cumulative_sum - k` exists in `sum_freq`. If it does, it means there's a previous subarray whose sum, when added to `k`, equals the current `cumulative_sum`.  Add the frequency of `cumulative_sum - k` to `count`.
    - Update the frequency of the current `cumulative_sum` in `sum_freq`.
  - Return `count`.

- **Data Structures:**
 - Hash Map (Dictionary in Python)

- **Time Complexity:**
 - O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once.  Hash map lookups and insertions take O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity:**
 - O(n) in the worst case. The hash map might store up to n distinct cumulative sums.
- **Trade-offs:**
 - This approach is significantly more efficient than the brute-force method due to the use of the hash map. It trades space for time.
### Brute Force Approach

 - **Algorithm:**
    - Iterate through all possible subarrays (nested loops).
    - For each subarray, calculate its sum.
    - If the sum equals k, increment the count.
  - **Data Structures:**
   - None

  - **Time Complexity:**
   - O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.  We have nested loops to generate all subarrays.
 - **Space Complexity:**
  - O(1).  We only use a few constant extra variables.
 - **Trade-offs:**
   - This method is simple to understand but extremely inefficient for larger arrays. It serves as a good baseline for comparison.

## Code

[Hash Map Approach](./solution_hashmap.py)
[Brute Force Approach](./solution_bruteforce.py)

## Notes (Optional)

- The hash map approach is the preferred solution due to its efficiency.
- The key idea behind the hash map approach is to recognize that if `cumulative_sum - k` exists in the hash map, then there must be a subarray with sum `k` ending at the current position.
- The brute-force approach is provided for comparison and to illustrate the difference in efficiency. It's highly recommended to use the hash map approach in practice.
```
- Step 5: Topics Extraction

Since the problem uses both Arrays and Hash Tables, we'll create separate files for each of those.  We already have `Arrays.md` from a previous response, so we just need to add the problem link to it and create `Hash Tables.md`.

#Arrays
Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science, serving as the building blocks for many algorithms and applications. They offer a way to store and manage collections of items, typically of the same data type, in a contiguous block of memory.

##Key Concepts

-   **Elements:** The individual items stored within an array.
-   **Index:** A numerical value (typically starting from 0) that represents the position of an element within the array.
-   **Length (or Size):** The total number of elements that an array can hold. This is often fixed when the array is created (static array) but can be dynamic in some languages/implementations.
-   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements in an array are stored in adjacent memory locations. This contiguity is crucial for efficient access.
-   **Data Type:** Arrays typically store elements of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all strings, all floating-point numbers).  However, some languages (like Python with its lists) allow for mixed data types.
-   **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays can have multiple dimensions, forming grids or matrices (2D arrays), cubes (3D arrays), or even higher-dimensional structures.

##Common Operations and Time Complexities
| Operation        | Description                                   | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Access (by index) | Retrieving the value at a specific index.      | O(1)                  | O(1)                      | O(1)                    |
| Search (linear) | Finding an element by iterating through.    | O(1)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Search (binary)  | Finding an element in a *sorted* array.     | O(1)                  | O(log n)                   | O(log n)                 |
| Insertion (end) | Adding an element at the end (if space).   | O(1)                  | O(1)                      | O(1) / O(n)             |
| Insertion (beg) | Adding at the beginning (requires shifting). | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Insertion (mid) | Adding in the middle (requires shifting).   | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Deletion (end)  | Removing the last element.                     | O(1)                  | O(1)                      | O(1)                    |
| Deletion (beg)  | Removing the first element (shifting).       | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Deletion (mid)  | Removing from the middle (shifting).        | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Update (by index)| Modifying the value at a specific index      |   O(1)                 |      O(1)                     |       O(1)                   |
-   **Access:**  Accessing an element by its index is extremely fast (O(1) - constant time) because the memory location can be calculated directly.
-   **Search:**
    -   *Linear Search:*  In an unsorted array, searching requires checking each element one by one (O(n) - linear time).
    -   *Binary Search:* In a *sorted* array, binary search can be used, which is significantly faster (O(log n) - logarithmic time).
-   **Insertion/Deletion:**
    -   *At the End:* If there's space available at the end of a dynamic array, inserting is O(1).  If resizing is needed, it can become O(n) in the worst case.
    -   *At the Beginning/Middle:* Inserting or deleting at the beginning or middle requires shifting elements, making it O(n).
##Types of Arrays
- **Static Arrays:** These have a fixed size determined at compile time.  They are very memory-efficient but cannot grow or shrink.  Languages like C, C++, and Java have static arrays.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** These can resize themselves automatically as needed.  They provide more flexibility but can have some performance overhead due to occasional resizing.  Examples include `std::vector` in C++, `ArrayList` in Java, and lists in Python.  Resizing typically involves allocating a new, larger block of memory and copying the existing elements.
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** These represent grids, matrices, or higher-dimensional structures.  A 2D array is like a table with rows and columns. They are stored in contiguous memory, usually in row-major or column-major order.

##Advantages of Arrays

-   **Fast Access:**  O(1) access to elements by index is a major advantage.
-   **Memory Efficiency:**  Static arrays are very memory-efficient because they store elements contiguously without overhead.
-   **Simplicity:**  Arrays are a relatively simple data structure to understand and use.
-   **Cache Friendliness:** Due to contiguous storage, arrays often exhibit good cache locality, leading to better performance.  Accessing nearby elements is faster because they are likely to be in the CPU cache.

##Disadvantages of Arrays

-   **Fixed Size (Static Arrays):**  Static arrays cannot change their size after creation.
-   **Insertion/Deletion Cost (Middle/Beginning):** Inserting or deleting elements in the middle or at the beginning is expensive (O(n)) because it requires shifting other elements.
-   **Wasted Space (Dynamic Arrays):** Dynamic arrays can sometimes waste space because they may allocate more memory than currently needed to accommodate future growth.

##Use Cases
Arrays are used extensively in:

-   Storing and accessing lists of data (e.g., student grades, sensor readings).
-   Implementing other data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, heaps).
-   Matrix and vector operations in mathematics and scientific computing.
-   Image processing (pixels are often represented as arrays).
-   Database systems.
-   Game development (e.g., representing game boards, positions of objects).

# Hash Tables

Hash tables (also known as hash maps, dictionaries, or associative arrays) are a fundamental data structure that provides very efficient key-value storage and retrieval. They use a **hash function** to map keys to indices in an array (called the hash table or hash map).

## Key Concepts

*   **Key:** The identifier used to store and retrieve a value. Keys should ideally be unique.
*   **Value:** The data associated with a key.
*   **Hash Function:** A function that takes a key as input and returns an integer, called the **hash code**.  The hash code is then used to determine the index in the array where the key-value pair will be stored.
*   **Collision:** When two different keys produce the same hash code, a collision occurs.
*   **Collision Resolution:**  Techniques for handling collisions.  The two main strategies are:
    *   **Separate Chaining:**  Each index in the array stores a linked list (or another data structure) of all key-value pairs that hash to that index.
    *   **Open Addressing:** If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for an empty slot in the array using a specific probing sequence (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing).
* **Load Factor:** The ratio of the number of stored key-value pairs (n) to the size of the array (m). `Load Factor = n/m` A high load factor can increase the likelihood of collisions and degrade performance.
* **Rehashing:**  When the load factor gets too high (or sometimes too low), the hash table is resized (usually doubled in size), and all existing key-value pairs are rehashed into the new, larger array.  This is an O(n) operation but is typically infrequent.

## Desirable Properties of a Hash Function

*   **Uniform Distribution:**  A good hash function should distribute keys evenly across the hash table to minimize collisions.
*   **Deterministic:**  The same key should always produce the same hash code.
*   **Efficient Computation:**  The hash function should be fast to compute.
*   **Avalanche Effect (for cryptographic hashes):**  A small change in the input key should result in a large change in the hash code.

## Common Operations and Time Complexities

| Operation        | Description                                     | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Insertion        | Adding a new key-value pair.                    | O(1)                       | O(n)                    |
| Deletion         | Removing a key-value pair.                    | O(1)                       | O(n)                    |
| Search (Lookup)  | Retrieving the value associated with a key.   | O(1)                       | O(n)                    |
| Update | change value of a key   | O(1)                       | O(n)                    |

*   **Average Case:**  With a good hash function and a reasonable load factor, hash table operations (insertion, deletion, lookup) typically take O(1) time on average.
*   **Worst Case:**  In the worst case (e.g., all keys hash to the same index, or a very poor hash function is used), all operations can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of key-value pairs. This is because we might have to traverse a long linked list (in separate chaining) or probe many slots (in open addressing).

## Advantages of Hash Tables

*   **Fast Operations (on average):**  Hash tables provide very fast average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and lookup (O(1)).
*   **Flexible Keys:**  Hash tables can use a wide variety of data types as keys, as long as a suitable hash function can be defined.
* **No inherent Order**: Hash Tables do not maintain order.

## Disadvantages of Hash Tables

*   **Worst-Case Performance:**  The worst-case performance can be O(n), although this is rare with good design.
*   **Space Overhead:**  Hash tables require extra space for the array, and there can be wasted space if the load factor is too low. Rehashing can also have a temporary memory overhead.
*   **Hash Function Dependence:** Performance heavily relies on the quality of the hash function.
* **No inherent Order**: Hash Tables do not maintain order.

## Use Cases

*   **Dictionaries/Associative Arrays:**  Storing and retrieving data based on keys (e.g., mapping names to phone numbers).
*   **Caching:**  Storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
*   **Symbol Tables (Compilers):**  Mapping variable names to their memory locations.
*   **Database Indexing:**  Speeding up data retrieval in databases.
*   **Sets:**  Implementing sets (collections of unique elements) efficiently.
*   **Counting Frequencies:**  Counting the occurrences of elements in a collection (as in the "Subarray Sum Equals K" problem).
