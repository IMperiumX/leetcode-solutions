Okay, let's create the solution, README, and topic files for LeetCode problem 542: "01 Matrix". This problem is a classic example of using Breadth-First Search (BFS) in a grid.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

* **Problem Number:** 542
* **Problem Name:** 01 Matrix
* **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

I'll create a folder named `0542-01-matrix`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

The most efficient approach is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS):

1. Initialize a queue with all the cells containing 0s.  These are our starting points.
2. Initialize a `dist` matrix (same dimensions as `mat`) with large values (e.g., infinity or -1) to represent unvisited cells. Set the distance of all 0 cells to 0.
3. Perform BFS:
    * Dequeue a cell from the queue.
    * For each of its 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right):
        * If the neighbor is within the grid bounds and hasn't been visited yet (its distance is still large), update its distance to be the distance of the current cell + 1, and enqueue the neighbor.

            if 0 <= new_row < m and 0 <= new_col < n and dist[new_row][new_col] == float('inf'):
                dist[new_row][new_col] = dist[row][col] + 1
                queue.append((new_row, new_col))

    return dist

# 542. 01 Matrix, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return *the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell*.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is 1.

**Example 1:**

```

Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]

```

**Constraints:**

-   `m == mat.length`
-   `n == mat[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`
-   `1 <= m * n <= 10^4`
-   `mat[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
-   There is at least one 0 in `mat`.

## Approach(es)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    -   Create a `dist` matrix of the same size as `mat`, initialized with large values (e.g., infinity) to represent unvisited cells.  Alternatively, you could use -1 and check for that.
    -   Create a queue `queue`.
    -   Iterate through `mat`.  For each cell containing a 0:
        -   Set `dist[i][j]` to 0.
        -   Add the cell's coordinates `(i, j)` to the `queue`.
2.  **BFS Traversal:**
    -   While the `queue` is not empty:
        -   Dequeue a cell `(row, col)` from the `queue`.
        -   For each of the 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the current cell:
            -   Calculate the coordinates of the neighbor (`new_row`, `new_col`).
            -   If the neighbor is within the grid bounds (`0 <= new_row < m` and `0 <= new_col < n`) and hasn't been visited yet (`dist[new_row][new_col]` is still infinity or -1):
                -   Update the distance of the neighbor: `dist[new_row][new_col] = dist[row][col] + 1`.
                -   Enqueue the neighbor `(new_row, new_col)`.
3.  Return the `dist` matrix.

**Data Structures:**

-   Queue (`queue`) - for BFS traversal.
-   2D Array (`dist`) - to store distances.

**Time Complexity:**

-   O(m \* n), where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix.  We visit each cell at most once.

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(m \* n) in the worst case (if all cells are 0s, the queue will hold all of them initially).  Also, we use the `dist` matrix, which is O(m\*n).

**Trade-offs:**

-   Efficient and the standard approach for this type of problem.
-   Uses BFS, a fundamental graph traversal algorithm.

## Notes

-   This problem is a classic example of using BFS to find the shortest distances in a grid.
-   The key idea is to start from all the 0 cells simultaneously and expand outwards.
-   The use of a queue ensures that we process cells in increasing order of distance from the 0s.
-   The `dist` matrix serves both as a visited array and as the output matrix.
-   This problem is similar to finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, where the grid cells are nodes and adjacent cells have edges with weight 1.

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that systematically explores a graph level by level. It starts at a source node and visits all its immediate neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until all reachable nodes have been visited. BFS is often used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Key Concepts

-   **Queue:** BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit.
-   **Visited Set/Array:**  A set (or array) is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant visits.
-   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph in layers, visiting all nodes at a given distance from the source before moving to nodes at the next distance.

## Algorithm

1.  **Initialization:**
    -   Create a queue `queue`.
    -   Create a set (or array) `visited` to track visited nodes.
    -   Enqueue the starting node `start_node` into the `queue`.
    -   Mark `start_node` as visited (add it to `visited`).
2.  **Traversal:**
    -   While the `queue` is not empty:
        -   Dequeue a node `current_node` from the `queue`.
        -   Process `current_node` (e.g., print its value, perform some calculation).
        -   For each neighbor `neighbor` of `current_node`:
            -   If `neighbor` has not been visited:
                -   Enqueue `neighbor` into the `queue`.
                -   Mark `neighbor` as visited.

## Time Complexity

-   O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  Each node and each edge is visited at most once.

## Space Complexity

-   O(V) in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices.  The queue can potentially hold all vertices in the worst case (e.g., a complete graph). The visited set also takes O(V) space.

## Applications

-   **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs:**  BFS can find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph.
-   **Finding Connected Components:**  BFS can be used to find all connected components in a graph.
-   **Level Order Traversal of Trees:** BFS can be used to traverse a tree level by level.
-   **Web Crawling:**  BFS can be used to crawl web pages, starting from a seed URL and visiting linked pages.
-   **Network Broadcasting:**  BFS can be used to simulate broadcasting messages in a network.
-   **Garbage Collection:**  Some garbage collection algorithms use BFS-like techniques to identify reachable objects.

## Trade-offs

-   **Advantages:**
    -   Guaranteed to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
    -   Relatively simple to implement.
-   **Disadvantages:**
    -   Can use a lot of memory (O(V)) for large graphs.
    -   Not suitable for weighted graphs (use Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm instead).

# Matrix (2D Array)

A matrix, in the context of programming and LeetCode problems, is typically represented as a 2D array (a list of lists in Python).  It's a rectangular grid of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

## Key Concepts

-   **Rows and Columns:** A matrix has `m` rows and `n` columns.
-   **Element:**  An individual value in the matrix, accessed using its row and column indices (e.g., `matrix[row][col]`).
-   **Dimensions:** The size of the matrix, often represented as `m x n`.
-   **Square Matrix:** A matrix with the same number of rows and columns (m = n).
-   **Traversal:**  Visiting each element in the matrix, typically in row-major order (row by row) or column-major order (column by column).
- **Neighbors** Adjacent cells.  Typically up, down, left, right.  Sometimes diagonals are included.

## Common Operations

-   **Accessing an element:** `matrix[row][col]`
-   **Updating an element:** `matrix[row][col] = new_value`
-   **Iterating through rows:**
    ```python
    for row in matrix:
        # Process each row
    ```
-   **Iterating through elements:**
    ```python
    for i in range(len(matrix)):  # Iterate through rows
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):  # Iterate through columns
            # Process matrix[i][j]
    ```
- **Finding Neighbors**
  ```python
      # Example, up, down, left, right
      row, col = current_cell
      directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
      for dr, dc in directions:
          new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
          if 0 <= new_row < len(matrix) and 0 <= new_col < len(matrix[0]):
              # Process neighbor at matrix[new_row][new_col]
  ```

* **Creating a matrix:**

    ```python
    # Create a 3x4 matrix filled with 0s
    matrix = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(3)]
    ```

* **Transposing a matrix:** Swapping rows and columns.

* **Rotating a matrix:** Rotating the matrix by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise).

## Time and Space Complexity

* **Accessing/Updating an element:** O(1)
* **Iterating through all elements:** O(m \* n)
* **Creating a matrix:** O(m \* n)
* **Space complexity of storing a matrix:** O(m * n)

## Applications

* **Image Processing:** Images are often represented as matrices of pixel values.
* **Game Development:** Game boards and maps can be represented as matrices.
* **Graph Representation:** Adjacency matrices can represent graphs.
* **Mathematical Computations:** Linear algebra, matrix multiplication, etc.
* **Dynamic Programming:** Many DP problems involve using 2D arrays to store intermediate results.
