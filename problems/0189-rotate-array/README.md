Okay, let's break down the process of generating a LeetCode solution repository for the "Rotate Array" problem (Problem 189).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `189. Rotate Array ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Response:** "Problem Number: 189, Problem Name: Rotate Array, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0189-rotate-array`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   Since the user didn't provide a solution, we'll generate them. We'll aim for at least three different approaches, as suggested by the "Follow up" in the problem description.

*   **Prompt 3.2:** "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Rotate Array` (Number: `189`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`."

    "If you know of multiple common approaches to solve the problem, generate separate solution files for each approach (e.g., `solution_bruteforce.py`, `solution_reverse.py`)."
*   **Prompt 3.1.1:** "Generate alternative solution. If you know of multiple common approaches to solve the problem, generate separate solution files for each approach (e.g., `solution_bruteforce.cpp`, `solution_hashmap.java`)."

*   Based on the prompt, we'll create the following files inside the `0189-rotate-array` directory:
    *   `solution_cyclic.py`: Implements a cyclic replacement approach.
    *   `solution_reverse.py`: Implements the array reversal approach.
    *   `solution_bruteforce.py`: Implements a simple, but less efficient approach.

# 189. Rotate Array, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105

## Approach(es)

### Cyclic Replacements
Algorithm:
  - Start from the beginning of the array.
  - For each element, calculate its new position after rotation.
  - Move the element to the new position, storing the value that was originally there.
  - Repeat this process with the stored value until we return to the starting position.
  - Move to the next element if a cycle completes before all elements are rotated.
Data Structures:
  - No extra data structures are used.
Time Complexity:
  - O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is moved exactly once.
Space Complexity:
  - O(1), as we perform the rotation in-place.
Trade-offs:
  - Efficient in terms of space. Slightly more complex to implement.

### Array Reversal
Algorithm:
  - Reverse the entire array.
  - Reverse the first k elements.
  - Reverse the remaining n-k elements.
Data Structures:
 - No extra data structures are used.
Time Complexity:
 - O(n), where n is the length of the array.  Each element is reversed a constant number of times.
Space Complexity:
 - O(1), as we perform the rotation in-place.
Trade-offs:
  - Relatively simple and efficient in both time and space.
### Brute Force
Algorithm:
  - For each rotation step:
    - Store the last element of the array.
    - Shift all elements one position to the right.
    - Place the stored last element at the beginning of the array.

Data Structures:
  - No extra data structures are used.
Time Complexity:
  - O(n*k), where n is the length of the array and k is the number of rotations.  Each rotation requires shifting all elements.
Space Complexity:
  - O(1), as we only use a few temporary variables.
Trade-offs:
 - Very simple to implement, but inefficient for large arrays or large k values.

[Cyclic Replacements](./solution_cyclic.py)
[Array Reversal](./solution_reverse.py)
[Brute Force](./solution_bruteforce.py)
## Notes (Optional)
The Array Reversal method is generally the preferred approach due to its efficiency and relative simplicity. The Brute Force approach is useful for understanding the problem but should be avoided for performance reasons in a real-world scenario. The cyclic replacements approach offers an alternative O(1) space solution.

#Arrays
Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science, serving as the building blocks for many algorithms and applications. They offer a way to store and manage collections of items, typically of the same data type, in a contiguous block of memory.

##Key Concepts

-   **Elements:** The individual items stored within an array.
-   **Index:** A numerical value (typically starting from 0) that represents the position of an element within the array.
-   **Length (or Size):** The total number of elements that an array can hold. This is often fixed when the array is created (static array) but can be dynamic in some languages/implementations.
-   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements in an array are stored in adjacent memory locations. This contiguity is crucial for efficient access.
-   **Data Type:** Arrays typically store elements of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all strings, all floating-point numbers).  However, some languages (like Python with its lists) allow for mixed data types.
-   **Multidimensional Arrays:** Arrays can have multiple dimensions, forming grids or matrices (2D arrays), cubes (3D arrays), or even higher-dimensional structures.

##Common Operations and Time Complexities
| Operation        | Description                                   | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Access (by index) | Retrieving the value at a specific index.      | O(1)                  | O(1)                      | O(1)                    |
| Search (linear) | Finding an element by iterating through.    | O(1)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Search (binary)  | Finding an element in a *sorted* array.     | O(1)                  | O(log n)                   | O(log n)                 |
| Insertion (end) | Adding an element at the end (if space).   | O(1)                  | O(1)                      | O(1) / O(n)             |
| Insertion (beg) | Adding at the beginning (requires shifting). | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Insertion (mid) | Adding in the middle (requires shifting).   | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Deletion (end)  | Removing the last element.                     | O(1)                  | O(1)                      | O(1)                    |
| Deletion (beg)  | Removing the first element (shifting).       | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Deletion (mid)  | Removing from the middle (shifting).        | O(n)                  | O(n)                      | O(n)                    |
| Update (by index)| Modifying the value at a specific index      |   O(1)                 |      O(1)                     |       O(1)                   |
-   **Access:**  Accessing an element by its index is extremely fast (O(1) - constant time) because the memory location can be calculated directly.
-   **Search:**
    -   *Linear Search:*  In an unsorted array, searching requires checking each element one by one (O(n) - linear time).
    -   *Binary Search:* In a *sorted* array, binary search can be used, which is significantly faster (O(log n) - logarithmic time).
-   **Insertion/Deletion:**
    -   *At the End:* If there's space available at the end of a dynamic array, inserting is O(1).  If resizing is needed, it can become O(n) in the worst case.
    -   *At the Beginning/Middle:* Inserting or deleting at the beginning or middle requires shifting elements, making it O(n).
##Types of Arrays
- **Static Arrays:** These have a fixed size determined at compile time.  They are very memory-efficient but cannot grow or shrink.  Languages like C, C++, and Java have static arrays.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** These can resize themselves automatically as needed.  They provide more flexibility but can have some performance overhead due to occasional resizing.  Examples include `std::vector` in C++, `ArrayList` in Java, and lists in Python.  Resizing typically involves allocating a new, larger block of memory and copying the existing elements.
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** These represent grids, matrices, or higher-dimensional structures.  A 2D array is like a table with rows and columns. They are stored in contiguous memory, usually in row-major or column-major order.

##Advantages of Arrays

-   **Fast Access:**  O(1) access to elements by index is a major advantage.
-   **Memory Efficiency:**  Static arrays are very memory-efficient because they store elements contiguously without overhead.
-   **Simplicity:**  Arrays are a relatively simple data structure to understand and use.
-   **Cache Friendliness:** Due to contiguous storage, arrays often exhibit good cache locality, leading to better performance.  Accessing nearby elements is faster because they are likely to be in the CPU cache.

##Disadvantages of Arrays

-   **Fixed Size (Static Arrays):**  Static arrays cannot change their size after creation.
-   **Insertion/Deletion Cost (Middle/Beginning):** Inserting or deleting elements in the middle or at the beginning is expensive (O(n)) because it requires shifting other elements.
-   **Wasted Space (Dynamic Arrays):** Dynamic arrays can sometimes waste space because they may allocate more memory than currently needed to accommodate future growth.

##Use Cases
Arrays are used extensively in:

-   Storing and accessing lists of data (e.g., student grades, sensor readings).
-   Implementing other data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, heaps).
-   Matrix and vector operations in mathematics and scientific computing.
-   Image processing (pixels are often represented as arrays).
-   Database systems.
-   Game development (e.g., representing game boards, positions of objects).
