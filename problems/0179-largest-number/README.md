Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for "Largest Number" (Problem 179).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `179. Largest Number ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Response:** "Problem Number: 179, Problem Name: Largest Number, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0179-largest-number`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   Since the user didn't provide a solution, we'll generate one.  The core idea is to use a custom sorting algorithm. We can't simply sort the numbers in descending order.  Instead, we need to compare string concatenations to determine the correct order.

*   **Prompt 3.2:** "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Largest Number` (Number: `179`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`."
     "If you know of multiple common approaches to solve the problem, generate separate solution files for each approach (e.g., `solution_custom_sort.py`, `solution_another_approach.py`)."

*   We'll create `solution_custom_sort.py`.

    *   **`solution_custom_sort.py`**

    ```python
    # 179. Largest Number - Custom Sort Approach

    from functools import cmp_to_key

    def largestNumber(nums: list[int]) -> str:
        """
        Arranges a list of non-negative integers to form the largest possible number.

        Args:
            nums: The list of integers.

        Returns:
            The largest number as a string.
        """

        def custom_compare(n1, n2):
            """
            Custom comparison function for sorting.
            Compares string concatenations (n1+n2) and (n2+n1).
            """
            return 1 if n1 + n2 < n2 + n1 else -1 if n1 + n2 > n2 + n1 else 0
        
        # Convert integers to strings
        num_strs = [str(num) for num in nums]
        
        # Sort the strings using the custom comparison function
        num_strs.sort(key=cmp_to_key(custom_compare))
        
        # Join the sorted strings to form the result
        result = "".join(num_strs)
        
        # Handle the case where the input contains only zeros
        return "0" if result[0] == '0' else result
    ```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file for the problem: `Largest Number` (Number: `179`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

*   Here's the generated `README.md`:

# 179. Largest Number, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Approach(es)

### Custom Sort
 - **Algorithm:**

    - Convert the input integers to strings.
    - Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings, `n1` and `n2`, by comparing their concatenations: `n1 + n2` and `n2 + n1`.  If `n1 + n2` is greater than `n2 + n1`, then `n1` should come before `n2` in the sorted order.
    - Use the custom comparison function with a sorting algorithm (like Python's built-in `sort` or `sorted`) to sort the string representations of the numbers.
    - Join the sorted strings to form the final result string.
    - Handle the edge case where the input array contains only zeros.  In this case, return "0" instead of a string of multiple zeros.
 - **Data Structures:**

    - List (to store the string representations of the numbers).
 - **Time Complexity:**
    - O(n log n * k), where n is the number of integers and k is the maximum length of a number string. The sorting takes O(n log n) comparisons. Each comparison involves string concatenation, which takes O(k) time in the worst case.
 - **Space Complexity:**
    - O(n) (or O(n*k) to include space to store the result), where n is the number of input numbers.  We create a list of string representations of the numbers. The space used by the sorting algorithm itself depends on the specific implementation (often O(log n) for the call stack in quicksort or mergesort).
 - **Trade-offs:**
 - This approach uses sorting as its basis, providing a relatively concise and efficient solution.  The key is the custom comparison function that correctly orders the numbers based on their string concatenations.

## Code

[Custom Sort Approach](./solution_custom_sort.py)

## Notes (Optional)

- The core concept is the custom comparison logic.  Simply sorting the numbers in descending order wouldn't work (e.g., for [3, 30], sorting in descending order would give "303", but "330" is larger).
- Python's `functools.cmp_to_key` is used to convert the comparison function to a key function, which is required by `sort`.
- The edge case of all zeros is handled explicitly to avoid returning a string like "000".
- Other sorting algorithms could be used, but the time complexity would still be dominated by the O(n log n) comparisons and the O(k) string concatenations within the comparisons.

Since this problem uses Sorting, we'll create separate file for it.

# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, used to arrange elements of a list (or array) in a specific order (ascending, descending, lexicographical, etc.).  There are numerous sorting algorithms, each with different performance characteristics and trade-offs.

## Key Concepts

*   **Comparison-Based Sorting:**  Algorithms that compare elements to determine their relative order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
*   **Non-Comparison-Based Sorting:** Algorithms that don't rely on comparing elements directly (e.g., Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort).  These algorithms often have restrictions on the input data (e.g., integers within a known range).
*   **In-Place Sorting:**  Algorithms that sort the data within the original array/list, without requiring significant extra memory (typically O(1) or O(log n) extra space).
*   **Stable Sorting:**  Algorithms that preserve the relative order of equal elements.  If two elements have the same value, their original order in the input is maintained in the sorted output.
*   **Adaptive Sorting:**  Algorithms whose performance improves if the input data is already partially sorted.

| Merge Sort       | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)                | O(n log n)              | O(n)             | Yes    | No       | Efficient and reliable general-purpose sorting algorithm. Divide and conquer.                                       |

* k = range for counting, number of digits for radix, and number of buckets for bucket

## Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm

The best sorting algorithm depends on the specific situation:

*   **Small Datasets:** For small datasets, the overhead of more complex algorithms (like Merge Sort or Quick Sort) might outweigh their benefits.  Insertion Sort can be a good choice.
*   **Nearly Sorted Data:** If the data is already nearly sorted, adaptive algorithms like Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort can be very efficient.
*   **General-Purpose Sorting:** Merge Sort and Heap Sort provide guaranteed O(n log n) performance. Quick Sort is often faster in practice, but its worst-case performance should be considered.
*   **Stability:** If stability is required, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort are stable.
*   **Memory Constraints:**  If memory is severely limited, in-place algorithms like Heap Sort or Quick Sort (with careful implementation) are preferred.
*   **Non-Comparison Sorting:** If the input data meets the requirements (e.g., integers within a known range), Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or Bucket Sort can provide linear time performance.
