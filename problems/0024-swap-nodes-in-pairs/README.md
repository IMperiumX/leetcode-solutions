Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for "Swap Nodes in Pairs" (Problem 24).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `24. Swap Nodes in Pairs ... [problem description]`."
*   **Output:** "Problem Number: 24, Problem Name: Swap Nodes in Pairs, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0024-swap-nodes-in-pairs`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

We'll generate two solutions: one iterative and one recursive.

*   **Prompt 3.2:** "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Swap Nodes in Pairs` (Number: `24`). ... Create files named `solution_iterative.py` and `solution_recursive.py`."

* We will need a ListNode Class to define the Linked list.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

*   Create `solution_iterative.py`:

```python
# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs - Iterative Solution

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val

    """
    dummy = ListNode(0)  # Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases.

        # Move pointers
        prev = first
        current = first.next

    return dummy.next
```

    # Base Cases:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head

    # Nodes to be swapped
    first = head
    second = head.next

    # Recursive call
    first.next = swapPairs_recursive(second.next)

    return second  # Return the new head (second node)
```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file for the problem: `Swap Nodes in Pairs` (Number: `24`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

```markdown
# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]

Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach(es)

### Iterative Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Dummy Node:** Create a dummy node `dummy` and set its `next` pointer to the `head` of the list. This simplifies handling edge cases (e.g., when the list has 0 or 1 nodes).
2.  **Pointers:** Initialize two pointers:
    *   `prev`: Points to the node *before* the pair to be swapped. Initially, `prev = dummy`.
    *   `current`: Points to the first node of the pair to be swapped. Initially, `current = head`.
3.  **Iteration:** While `current` and `current.next` are not None (meaning there's a pair to swap):
    *   `first`: Store a reference to the first node (`current`).
    *   `second`: Store a reference to the second node (`current.next`).
    *   **Rewire Pointers (Swap):**
        *   `prev.next = second` (Connect the previous node to the second node).
        *   `first.next = second.next` (Connect the first node to the node after the second).
        *   `second.next = first` (Connect the second node to the first node).
    *   **Move Pointers:**
        *   `prev = first` (Move `prev` to the first node, which is now in the second position).
        *   `current = first.next` (Move `current` to the next pair's first node).
4.  **Return:** Return `dummy.next`, which is the new head of the modified list.

Data Structures:

*   Linked List (no additional data structures beyond pointers).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. We traverse the list once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used (for pointers).

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is efficient and uses constant extra space. It directly manipulates the pointers to swap the nodes.

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Base Cases:**
    *   If the list is empty (`head` is None) or has only one node (`head.next` is None), return `head` (nothing to swap).
2.  **Nodes to Swap:**
    *   `first`: Store a reference to the first node (`head`).
    *   `second`: Store a reference to the second node (`head.next`).
3.  **Recursive Call:**
    *   Recursively call `swapPairs` on the rest of the list (starting from `second.next`).  This will swap the remaining pairs.  Assign the result of this recursive call to `first.next`.  This connects the first node to the swapped rest of the list.
4.  **Swap:**
    *   `second.next = first` (Connect the second node to the first node).
5.  **Return:** Return `second`, which is now the new head of the (partially) swapped list.

Data Structures:

*   Linked List (no additional data structures beyond pointers).
*   Call stack (due to recursion).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes. Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - In the worst case (a list with n nodes), the recursion depth can be n/2, which is still O(n) due to the call stack.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is often considered more concise and elegant for linked list manipulations. However, it uses the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow for very long lists (although this is less likely with lists of length <= 100, as per the constraints).  The iterative approach is generally preferred for its constant space complexity.

# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are not stored in contiguous memory locations like arrays. Instead, each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Key Concepts

*   **Node:** The fundamental building block of a linked list. Each node contains:
    *   **Data:** The value stored in the node.
    *   **Next Pointer:** A reference (link) to the next node in the list. The last node's next pointer is typically `None` (or `null` in some languages).
*   **Head:** The first node in the list. It serves as the entry point to the list.
*   **Tail:** The last node in the list. Its `next` pointer is `None`.
*   **Singly Linked List:** Each node has a pointer only to the *next* node.
*   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has pointers to both the *next* and *previous* nodes. This allows for traversal in both directions.
*   **Circular Linked List:** The last node's `next` pointer points back to the head, forming a cycle.

## Common Operations and Time Complexities (Singly Linked List)

| Operation            | Description                                   | Time Complexity (Average/Worst) |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Access (by index)   | Get the element at a specific index           | O(n)                              |
| Search (by value)   | Find a node with a specific value             | O(n)                              |
| Insertion (at head) | Add a new node at the beginning               | O(1)                              |
| Insertion (at tail) | Add a new node at the end                    | O(n) (without tail pointer), O(1) (with tail pointer) |
| Insertion (middle)  | Add a new node after a given node            | O(1) (if you have a reference to the given node), O(n) (if you need to search for it) |
| Deletion (at head)  | Remove the first node                        | O(1)                              |
| Deletion (at tail)  | Remove the last node                         | O(n) (without tail pointer), O(1) (with doubly-linked list and tail pointer) |
| Deletion (middle)   | Remove a node after a given node             | O(1) (if you have a reference to the given node), O(n) (if you need to search for it) |
| Traversal           | Visit all nodes                               | O(n)                              |

*   **n:** The number of nodes in the list.

## Doubly Linked List Time Complexities

Doubly linked lists have similar time complexities to singly linked lists, with a few key differences:

*   **Insertion/Deletion (at tail):** O(1) if you have a tail pointer.
*   **Traversal (reverse):** O(n) - can traverse in reverse order.

## Advantages

*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, as needed.
*   **Efficient Insertion/Deletion (at head/middle):**  Insertion and deletion at the beginning or middle (given a reference to a node) are O(1), unlike arrays where elements might need to be shifted.
*   **No Memory Waste (compared to fixed-size arrays):** Linked lists allocate memory only for the nodes they contain.

## Disadvantages

*   **No Random Access:** Accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the head (O(n)). Arrays provide O(1) random access.
*   **Extra Memory Overhead:** Each node requires extra memory to store the pointer(s) to the next (and previous, in doubly linked lists) node(s).
*   **Cache Inefficiency:**  Nodes are not necessarily stored contiguously in memory, which can lead to more cache misses compared to arrays.

## Use Cases

Linked lists are suitable for situations where:

*   Frequent insertions and deletions are needed, especially at the beginning or middle of the list.
*   The size of the data is not known in advance or changes frequently.
*   Random access is not a primary requirement.
* Implementing stacks, queues and graphs.
