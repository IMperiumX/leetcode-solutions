# 322. Coin Change, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the *fewest number of coins* that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an *infinite* number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
-   `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
-   `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

## Approach(es)

### Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up/Tabulation)

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    -   Create a `dp` array of size `amount + 1`.  `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of coins needed to make up amount `i`.
    -   Initialize all elements of `dp` to infinity (or a large value like `amount + 1`). This signifies that we haven't found a way to make up those amounts yet.
    -   Set `dp[0] = 0`.  We need 0 coins to make up an amount of 0.
2.  **Iteration:**
    -   Iterate through the `dp` array from `i = 1` to `amount`:
        -   For each amount `i`, iterate through the available `coins`:
            -   If `i - coin >= 0` (meaning we can use the current `coin` without going negative):
                -   Update `dp[i]` with the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1`.  This means we're considering using the current `coin` and adding 1 to the minimum number of coins needed to make up the remaining amount (`i - coin`).
3.  **Result:**
    -   After the iterations, `dp[amount]` will contain the minimum number of coins needed to make up the target `amount`.
    -   If `dp[amount]` is still infinity, it means we couldn't make up the amount, so return -1.  Otherwise, return `dp[amount]`.

**Data Structures:**

-   `dp` array (list in Python)

**Time Complexity:**

-   O(amount \* len(coins)).  We have nested loops iterating through amounts and coins.

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(amount) to store the `dp` array.

**Trade-offs:**

-   Efficient and the standard approach for this problem.
-   Uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

## Notes

- This is a classic dynamic programming problem, often used to illustrate the concept of bottom-up (tabulation) DP.
- The key idea is to build up solutions for smaller amounts and use them to find solutions for larger amounts.
- The initialization of `dp[0] = 0` is a crucial base case.
- The use of infinity (or a large value) as the initial value in `dp` allows us to easily track whether a particular amount can be made up or not.
-  A top-down (memoized) recursive solution is also possible, but the bottom-up approach is generally preferred for its iterative nature and avoidance of recursion overhead.

# Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

## Key Concepts

-   **Optimal Substructure:** A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
-   **Overlapping Subproblems:** A problem has overlapping subproblems if the same subproblems are solved multiple times during the recursive solution.  DP avoids recomputing these subproblems by storing their solutions.
-   **Memoization (Top-Down):**  A recursive approach where we store the results of subproblems in a table (usually a hash map or array) to avoid recomputation.  We "memoize" the results.
-   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**  An iterative approach where we build up a table of solutions to subproblems in a bottom-up manner, starting with the smallest subproblems and working our way up to the original problem.

## Steps to Solve DP Problems

1.  **Identify Optimal Substructure:** Determine how an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.  Define the recursive relationship.
2.  **Identify Overlapping Subproblems:**  Observe if the same subproblems are being solved repeatedly in the recursive approach.
3.  **Choose Memoization (Top-Down) or Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**
    -   **Memoization:**  Start with the original problem and recursively break it down, storing the results of subproblems as you go.
    -   **Tabulation:**  Start with the smallest subproblems and build up the solution iteratively, filling a table.
4.  **Define the Table (Memoization or Tabulation):**
    -   Determine the dimensions and meaning of the table entries.  `dp[i]`, `dp[i][j]`, etc.
5.  **Base Cases:**  Identify the base cases for the recursion (memoization) or the initial values for the table (tabulation).
6.  **Iterative/Recursive Relation:**  Define the formula or logic for calculating the solution to a subproblem based on the solutions to smaller subproblems.
7.  **Return the Result:**  Identify the entry in the table (or the result of the top-level recursive call) that represents the solution to the original problem.

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence (Tabulation)

```python
def fibonacci_tabulation(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # dp[i] stores the i-th Fibonacci number
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]  # Recurrence relation
    return dp[n]
```
## Example: Fibonacci Sequence (Memoization)

```python
def fibonacci_memoization(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memoization(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memoization(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

## Time and Space Complexity

-   The time and space complexity of DP solutions depend on the size of the table and the number of subproblems.
-   Often, the time complexity is O(size of the table) and the space complexity is O(size of the table).

## Applications

-   **Shortest Path Problems:**  Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
-   **Knapsack Problem:**  Finding the most valuable subset of items that can fit in a knapsack with a limited capacity.
-   **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**  Finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
-   **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**  Finding the longest increasing subsequence in a sequence.
-   **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance):**  Finding the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to transform one string into another.
-   **Coin Change:**  Finding the fewest number of coins to make up a given amount.
-   **Matrix Chain Multiplication:**  Finding the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices.
- **Fibonacci Numbers**

## Trade-offs

-   **Advantages:**
    -   Can significantly improve the efficiency of algorithms by avoiding redundant computations.
    -   Often leads to polynomial-time solutions for problems that would otherwise have exponential time complexity.
-   **Disadvantages:**
    -   Can require significant memory to store the table of subproblem solutions.
    -   Can be more complex to design and implement than simple recursive solutions.  Identifying the optimal substructure and recurrence relation can be challenging.
