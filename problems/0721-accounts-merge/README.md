# 721. Accounts Merge, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a list of accounts where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

Input: `accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]`
Output: `[["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]`
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.

**Example 2:**

Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= `accounts.length` <= 1000
*   2 <= `accounts[i].length` <= 10
*   1 <= `accounts[i][j].length` <= 30
*   `accounts[i][0]` consists of English letters.
*   `accounts[i][j]` (for j > 0) is a valid email.

## Approach(es)

### Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure with `n` sets, where `n` is the number of accounts.  Each account initially represents its own disjoint set.
2.  **Email to Account Mapping:** Create a dictionary (hash map) to map each email to a list of account indices that contain that email.
3.  **Union by Email:** Iterate through the email-to-account mapping. For each email, if it belongs to multiple accounts, use the `union` operation of the DSU to merge the corresponding sets (accounts).
4.  **Group Emails by Root:** After performing all unions, iterate through the accounts again. For each account, find its root using the `find` operation of the DSU.  Group emails belonging to the same root account.
5.  **Format Output:**  Create the final result list. For each root account, combine the account name with the sorted and de-duplicated list of emails.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):** Implemented using an array for parent pointers and optionally a rank array for optimization (union by rank).  Path compression is also used for optimization.
*   **Dictionary (Hash Map):**  `email_to_account_indices`: Maps emails to a list of account indices.
*   **Dictionary (Hash Map):** `merged_accounts`: Groups emails by their root account index.
*    List.

**Time Complexity:**

*   **Near O(n * α(n))**, where `n` is the total number of accounts and α(n) is the Inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly (almost constant for practical input sizes).  The dominant operations are the `find` and `union` operations of the DSU, which are nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank. The sorting of emails within each merged account takes O(m log m) time where *m* is the number of email.
**Space Complexity:**

*   **O(n)**, where `n` is the total number of accounts (or emails, as they are proportional).  This is due to the space used by the DSU data structure, the email-to-account mapping, and the merged accounts dictionary.

**Trade-offs:**

*   The DSU approach provides a very efficient solution for merging accounts based on common emails. The main advantage is the near-constant time complexity of the `find` and `union` operations.

# Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)

Disjoint Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations to:

1.  **`find(x)`:** Determine which subset a particular element `x` belongs to. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
2.  **`union(x, y)`:** Join two subsets into a single subset.  If `x` and `y` were in different subsets, these subsets are merged.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Disjoint Sets:** A collection of sets where no element is present in more than one set.
*   **Representative (Root):** Each subset is represented by a single element, often called the "root" or "representative" of that subset.
*   **Path Compression (Optimization):** During a `find` operation, we update the parent pointer of each visited node to point directly to the root. This flattens the tree structure and makes subsequent `find` operations faster.
*   **Union by Rank (Optimization):** During a `union` operation, we attach the root of the "smaller" tree to the root of the "larger" tree.  "Size" can be measured by the number of nodes (union by size) or by the "rank" (an upper bound on the height of the tree - union by rank). This helps keep the tree relatively balanced.

**Implementation (with Path Compression and Union by Rank):**

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))  # Initially, each element is its own parent
        self.rank = [0] * n  # Initialize ranks to 0

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        root_x = self.find(x)
        root_y = self.find(y)
        if root_x != root_y:
            if self.rank[root_x] < self.rank[root_y]:
                self.parent[root_x] = root_y
            elif self.rank[root_x] > self.rank[root_y]:
                self.parent[root_y] = root_x
            else:
                self.parent[root_y] = root_x
                self.rank[root_x] += 1
```

**Time Complexity:**

*   **`find(x)`:**  Near O(α(n)), where α(n) is the Inverse Ackermann function.  This is almost constant for practical input sizes.
*   **`union(x, y)`:** Near O(α(n)).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n), where `n` is the number of elements.

**Applications:**

*   **Cycle Detection in Graphs:** DSU can efficiently determine if a graph contains cycles.
*   **Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal's Algorithm):** DSU is used to keep track of connected components during Kruskal's algorithm.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Determining if two nodes in a network are connected.

# Hash Table

A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a *hash function* to compute an *index*, also called a *hash code*, into an array of *buckets* or *slots*, from which the desired value can be found.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Hash Function:** A function that takes a key as input and returns an integer, the hash code. A good hash function should:
    *   Be deterministic (same key always produces the same hash code).
    *   Be efficient to compute.
    *   Distribute keys uniformly across the hash table to minimize collisions.
*   **Collision:** When two different keys produce the same hash code.
*   **Collision Resolution:** Techniques to handle collisions, including:
    *   **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
    *   **Open Addressing:** If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for an empty slot in the table.  Common probing strategies include:
        *   Linear Probing: Search sequentially for the next available slot.
        *   Quadratic Probing:  Increase the probe distance quadratically.
        *   Double Hashing: Use a second hash function to determine the probe distance.

**Common Operations and Time Complexities (Average Case):**

*   **Insertion:** O(1) - Constant time on average, assuming a good hash function and collision resolution strategy.  Worst case can be O(n) if all keys hash to the same bucket.
*   **Deletion:** O(1) - Constant time on average.  Worst case can be O(n).
*   **Search:** O(1) - Constant time on average.  Worst case can be O(n).

**Python Dictionaries:**

Python's `dict` data type is a highly optimized implementation of a hash table. It uses open addressing with a combination of techniques to handle collisions efficiently.

**Applications**
* Counting
* Grouping
* Caching
* Indexing

# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters. They are a fundamental data type in most programming languages and are used to represent text.

**Key Properties:**

*   **Immutability (in many languages):** In languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.
*   **Mutability (in some languages):** In languages like C++, strings (using `std::string`) are mutable.
*   **Character Encoding:** Strings are stored as a sequence of bytes, and a character encoding (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16) is used to map those bytes to characters.  UTF-8 is the most common encoding for web pages and is widely supported.
* **Indexing and Slicing**: In python you can access an individual character or sub-string from a string.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together. In Python, this is done using the `+` operator.  In Java, you can use `+` or the `concat()` method. In C++, you can use `+` or `append()`.
*   **Length:** Getting the number of characters in a string.  In Python, use `len()`.  In Java, use `length()`. In C++, use `length()` or `size()`.
*   **Substring:** Extracting a portion of a string. In Python, use slicing (`string[start:end]`).  In Java, use `substring()`. In C++, use `substr()`.
*   **Comparison:** Comparing two strings lexicographically. In Python, use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`). In Java, use `equals()`, `compareTo()`. In C++, use comparison operators or `compare()`.
*   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a substring within a string. In Python, use `in`, `find()`, or `index()`. In Java, use `indexOf()`, `contains()`.  In C++, use `find()`.
*   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter. In Python, use `split()`.  In Java, use `split()`. In C++, use a combination of `find()` and `substr()`, or use a stringstream.
*   **Joining:** Combining a list of strings into a single string, using a separator. In Python, use `join()`. In Java, use `String.join()` (Java 8+) or a `StringBuilder`.  In C++, use a loop and string concatenation or a stringstream.
*   **Case Conversion:**  Converting a string to uppercase or lowercase. In Python, use `upper()` and `lower()`. In Java, use `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`.  In C++, use `std::transform` with `std::toupper` and `std::tolower`.
* **Striping:** Removing leading/trailing whitespaces.
