# 528. Random Pick with Weight, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of the i<sup>th</sup> index.

You need to implement the function `pickIndex()`, which randomly picks an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]` (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

For example, if `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking index 0 is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e., 75%).

**Example 1:**

Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.

**Example 2:**

Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= w.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   1 <= w[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   `pickIndex` will be called at most 10<sup>4</sup> times.

## Approach(es)

### Prefix Sums and Binary Search

Algorithm:

1.  **Prefix Sums:** Calculate the prefix sums of the weights array `w`. The prefix sum at index `i` represents the sum of weights from index 0 to `i`.  This transforms the weights into ranges.
2.  **Random Number Generation:** Generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and the total sum of weights (exclusive).
3.  **Binary Search:** Use binary search on the prefix sums array to find the *smallest* index where the prefix sum is greater than or equal to the generated random number. This index corresponds to the selected index based on the weights.

Data Structures:

*   List (Array): To store the prefix sums.

Time Complexity:

*   `__init__`: O(N), where N is the length of the weights array `w`. We iterate through `w` once to calculate prefix sums.
*   `pickIndex`: O(log N), due to binary search.

Space Complexity:

*   O(N):  We store the prefix sums in an array of size N.

Trade-offs:
-   The prefix sums approach with binary search provides a good balance between initialization time and the time complexity of `pickIndex`.
- It's significantly faster than a linear scan for large input arrays.

## Notes (Optional)

-   The use of `bisect.bisect_left` in Python is crucial for finding the correct index in the prefix sums array.  It efficiently performs binary search and returns the insertion point.
-   The random number is generated within the range [0, `total_sum`), ensuring that indices with larger weights have a proportionally higher chance of being selected.
- This problem can be thought of as dividing a line segment into subsegments with lengths proportional to the weights, then randomly picking a point on the line segment and finding the corresponding subsegment.
```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The main topics related to this problem are:

1.  **Prefix Sum:** Used for efficiently representing the weighted ranges.
2.  **Binary Search:** Used for efficiently finding the selected index.
3.  **Probability/Randomization:** The core concept of the problem.

We'll generate the following files:

*   `Prefix_Sum.md`
*   `Probability.md`
 We will use the `Binary_Search.md` generated before.

# Prefix Sum

## Explanation

A prefix sum (also known as a cumulative sum) is a sequence where each element is the sum of all preceding elements in the original sequence.  It's a useful technique for efficiently answering range sum queries.

Given an array `arr`, the prefix sum array `prefix_sum` is defined as:

`prefix_sum[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]`

Key Concepts:

*   **Cumulative Sum:** Each element in the prefix sum array represents the cumulative sum up to that point.
*   **Range Sum Queries:**  The sum of elements in a range `[i, j]` can be calculated as `prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]` (or `prefix_sum[j]` if `i` is 0).

Advantages:

*   **Efficient Range Sum Queries:**  Range sums can be calculated in O(1) time after the prefix sum array is built.
*   **Simple Implementation:**  Prefix sums are easy to calculate.

Common Uses:

*   Answering range sum queries.
*   Finding subarrays with a specific sum.
*   Problems involving weighted probabilities (like in this LeetCode problem).
* Image processing (integral image).

## Example (Python):

```python
def calculate_prefix_sum(arr):
    prefix_sum = [0] * len(arr)
    prefix_sum[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + arr[i]
    return prefix_sum

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
prefix_sum = calculate_prefix_sum(arr)
print(prefix_sum)  # Output: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]

# Range sum query [2, 4] (inclusive, 0-indexed)
i = 2
j = 4
range_sum = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1] if i > 0 else prefix_sum[j] # range_sum: 3 + 4+ 5 = 12
print(range_sum)

```

# Binary Search
## Explanation
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a *sorted* array (or list). It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the middle element is the target, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the interval is empty.

Key Concepts:

- **Sorted Input:** Binary search *requires* the input array to be sorted.
- **Divide and Conquer:**  The search space is repeatedly halved.
- **Logarithmic Time Complexity:** Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it very efficient for large datasets.
- **Left, Right, and Middle Pointers:**  Used to track the search interval.

Algorithm (Iterative):

1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. While `left <= right`:
    - Calculate the middle index: `mid = (left + right) // 2`
    - If `arr[mid] == target`: return `mid`
    - If `arr[mid] < target`:  `left = mid + 1`
    - If `arr[mid] > target`:  `right = mid - 1`
3. If the loop finishes without finding the target, return -1 (or an appropriate indicator that the target is not present).
## Example (Python):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Integer division
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage
arr = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target = 11
index = binary_search(arr, target)
print(index)
```
```python
#Using bisect module
import bisect
arr = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target = 11
index = bisect.bisect_left(arr,target)
if index < len(arr) and arr[index] == target:
    print(index)
else:
    print(-1) #Target not found

```

# Probability

## Explanation

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is to occur.

Key concepts:

*   **Sample Space:** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
*   **Event:** A subset of the sample space (a set of outcomes).
*   **Probability of an Event:** P(E) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)  (This applies to cases with equally likely outcomes).
*   **Independent Events:** Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.  P(A and B) = P(A) \* P(B)
*   **Mutually Exclusive Events:** Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
*   **Conditional Probability:** The probability of an event given that another event has occurred. P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
* **Random Variable**: is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.
* **Probability Distribution**: describes how the total probability of 1 is distributed.
* **Expected value** of random variable X is  the average of the possible values of X, weighted by their probabilities.
## Example (Python):

```python
import random

# Simulate rolling a six-sided die
def roll_die():
    return random.randint(1, 6)

# Simulate flipping a fair coin
def flip_coin():
    return "Heads" if random.random() < 0.5 else "Tails"

# Example: Probability of rolling an even number
rolls = [roll_die() for _ in range(1000)]
even_count = rolls.count(2) + rolls.count(4) + rolls.count(6)
probability_even = even_count / len(rolls)

print(f"Probability of rolling an even number (simulated): {probability_even}")  # Should be close to 0.5

# Example: Generating a random number with weighted probabilities
weights = [1, 3, 2] #index 0 has weight = 1
prefix_sums = []
prefix_sum = 0
for weight in weights:
  prefix_sum += weight
  prefix_sums.append(prefix_sum)
total_sum = prefix_sum
target = total_sum*random.random()
import bisect
index = bisect.bisect_left(prefix_sums,target)
print(f"Randomly picked index based on weigth: {index}")
```
