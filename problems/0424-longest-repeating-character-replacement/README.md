# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement - Sliding Window Approach

def characterReplacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the length of the longest substring with at most k character replacements.
    """
    count = {}  # Frequency map of characters in the current window

# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

**Example 1:**

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exist other ways to achieve this answer too.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   s consists of only uppercase English letters.
*   0 <= k <= s.length

## Approach(es)

### Sliding Window Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize a dictionary `count` to store character frequencies, `left` pointer to 0, `max_length` to 0, and `max_frequency` (the count of the most frequent character in the current window) to 0.
2.  Iterate through the string `s` with the `right` pointer.
3.  Update the frequency of the character at `s[right]` in the `count` dictionary.
4.  Update `max_frequency` with the maximum frequency seen so far in the current window.
5.  Check if the current window is valid: `(right - left + 1) - max_frequency > k`.  This condition checks if the number of characters we need to replace (window size - most frequent character count) exceeds `k`.
6.  If the window is invalid (we need to replace more than `k` characters), shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right and decrementing the count of the character that is no longer in the window.
7.  Update `max_length` with the maximum length seen so far.
8.  Return `max_length`.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (Hash Map): To store the frequency of characters within the current window.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N), where N is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), because the `count` dictionary will store at most 26 key-value pairs (uppercase English alphabet).

Trade-offs:

-   The sliding window approach offers an efficient way to solve this problem with linear time complexity.  It avoids redundant calculations by maintaining a window of characters and adjusting it dynamically.

## Code

[Sliding Window Approach](./solution_sliding_window.py)

## Notes (Optional)

-   The key insight is to maintain a sliding window and check if the window is "valid" based on the number of replacements needed.
-   We use a dictionary to efficiently track character frequencies within the window.
-   Keeping track of `max_frequency` avoids having to iterate through the `count` dictionary in each step.
```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The main topics related to this problem are:

1.  **Sliding Window:** The core technique used for the solution.
2. **Hash Table / Dictionary:** For counting the occurrences.
3. **String Manipulation:**  Although not as central as the other two.

I will generate the respective files for each topic:

*   `Sliding_Window.md`
*   `Hash_Table.md`
*  `String_Manipulation.md` (We'll reuse the `String_Manipulation.md` file from the previous response, and add the new problem)

# Sliding Window

## Explanation

The sliding window technique is a common approach for solving problems involving arrays or strings where you need to find a subrange (window) that satisfies a certain condition.  The basic idea is to maintain a "window" over the input data, and expand or shrink the window based on the problem's constraints.

Key concepts:

*   **Left and Right Pointers:**  Define the boundaries of the window.
*   **Window Expansion:** Move the right pointer to expand the window.
*   **Window Contraction:** Move the left pointer to shrink the window.
*   **Validity Check:**  A condition that determines whether the current window is valid or needs to be adjusted.

Common uses:

*   Finding the longest/shortest substring with certain properties.
*   Finding subarrays with a specific sum.
*   Optimizing problems that might otherwise require nested loops.

## Example (Python):

```python
# Find the longest substring without repeating characters
def longest_substring_without_repeating_chars(s):
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len

```

# Hash Table

## Explanation

A hash table (also known as a hash map or dictionary) is a data structure that implements an associative array, which maps keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

Key Concepts:

- **Hash Function:** A function that maps keys to indices in the hash table.  A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the buckets to minimize collisions.
- **Collision Handling:**  Strategies for dealing with situations where different keys map to the same index.  Common techniques include chaining (using linked lists) and open addressing (probing for an empty slot).
- **Key-Value Pairs:** The fundamental elements stored in a hash table.
- **Load Factor** is the ratio of the number of elements to the size.

Advantages:

- **Fast Lookups:**  On average, hash table operations (insert, delete, search) take O(1) time.
- **Efficient Storage:**  Hash tables can store a large number of key-value pairs efficiently.
- **Flexibility:**  Hash tables can be used to store a wide variety of data types.

Disadvantages:
- **Worst-Case Performance**: In the worst case (e.g. all keys hash to the same index), hash table operations can take O(n) time, where is the number of keys.
- **Space Overhead**: Hash tables require extra space for the array of buckets and, depending on the collision handling strategy, additional data structures like linked lists.

Common uses:

- **Counting frequencies (as in this problem).**
- **Implementing caches.**
- **Detecting duplicates.**
- **Representing sets.**
- **Database indexing.**

## Example (Python):

```python
# Using Python's built-in dictionary (which is a hash table)
my_dict = {}

# Insert key-value pairs
my_dict["apple"] = 1
my_dict["banana"] = 2
my_dict["cherry"] = 3

# Access values by key
print(my_dict["banana"])  # Output: 2

# Check if a key exists
if "apple" in my_dict:
    print("Apple exists")

# Delete a key-value pair
del my_dict["cherry"]

# Iterate through keys
for key in my_dict:
    print(key, my_dict[key])

# Get keys, values or items
print(list(my_dict.keys()))
print(list(my_dict.values()))
print(list(my_dict.items())) # [('apple', 1), ('banana', 2)]
```

# String Manipulation
## Explanation
String manipulation refers to the various operations that can be performed on strings. This includes tasks such as:

-   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
-   **Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a string.
-   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a substring within a string.
-   **Replacing:** Replacing parts of a string with another string.
-   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
- **Formatting:** Creating strings with specific formatting (e.g., padding, alignment).
- **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of characters in a string (e.g., uppercase, lowercase).
- **Trimming:** Removing whitespace from the beginning or end of a string.

## Example in Python

```python
# Concatenation
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
combined = str1 + " " + str2  # combined is "Hello World"

# Slicing
text = "abcdefgh"
substring = text[2:5]   # substring is "cde"

# Searching
sentence = "This is a sentence."
index = sentence.find("is")  # index is 2

#Replacing
new_sentence = sentence.replace("sentence", "string")  # new_sentence is "This is a string."

#Splitting
words = sentence.split(" ") #words is ['This','is','a','sentence.']

#Formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
#Formatted string is: "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old"

#Case Conversion
upper_case = sentence.upper() #upper_case = "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

#Trimming
spaced_string = "   extra spaces   "
trimmed_string = spaced_string.strip() #"extra spaces"
```
