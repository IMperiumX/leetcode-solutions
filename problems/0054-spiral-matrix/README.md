# 54. Spiral Matrix, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

**Example 1:**

Input: `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
Output: `[1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]`
Output: `[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]`

**Constraints:**

*   `m == matrix.length`
*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 10`
*   `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

## Approach(es)

### Layer-by-Layer Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** Define four boundary variables: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. Initialize them to the boundaries of the matrix.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate while `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`:
    *   **Traverse Top Row:** Iterate from `left` to `right` and add elements of the top row to the result. Increment `top`.
    *   **Traverse Right Column:** Iterate from `top` to `bottom` and add elements of the right column to the result. Decrement `right`.
    *   **Traverse Bottom Row (Conditional):** If `top <= bottom`, iterate from `right` to `left` (in reverse) and add elements of the bottom row to the result. Decrement `bottom`. The `top <= bottom` check prevents processing the same row twice in cases where there's only one row left.
    *   **Traverse Left Column (Conditional):** If `left <= right`, iterate from `bottom` to `top` (in reverse) and add elements of the left column to the result. Increment `left`.  The `left <= right` check prevents processing the same column twice when there's only one column remaining.

**Data Structures:**

*   List to store the resulting spiral order.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We visit each element of the matrix exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) for the algorithm itself (excluding the output list).  If we include the output list, it's O(m * n) because we store all elements.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This is an intuitive and efficient approach.  It avoids recursion and directly manipulates the boundaries to traverse the matrix in a spiral manner. The conditional checks for traversing the bottom and left sides are crucial for handling matrices that are not square.

# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science.  They store a collection of elements of the *same data type*, accessed using an index (typically an integer).

**Key Properties:**

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient access to elements using their index.
*   **Fixed Size (in many languages):**  In languages like C, C++, and Java, arrays often have a fixed size determined at compile time.  Dynamic arrays (like Python lists) can resize, but this comes with a performance cost.
*   **Zero-Based Indexing (usually):**  Most programming languages use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:**  All elements in an array are typically of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all strings).  Some languages (like Python) allow for heterogeneous lists, but these are technically not "arrays" in the strictest sense.

**Common Operations and Time Complexities:**

*   **Access (by index):** O(1) - Constant time, due to contiguous memory.
*   **Insertion (at the end, for dynamic arrays):**  Amortized O(1) - Usually fast, but can be O(n) if resizing is required.
*   **Insertion (at a specific index):** O(n) - Requires shifting elements to make space.
*   **Deletion (at a specific index):** O(n) - Requires shifting elements to fill the gap.
*   **Search (unsorted array):** O(n) - Linear search.
*   **Search (sorted array):** O(log n) - Binary search.

**Python Lists:**

Python's `list` data type is a dynamic array. It provides flexibility (resizing, heterogeneous elements) but can be less memory-efficient than fixed-size arrays in other languages.

# Matrix Traversal

Matrix traversal refers to the process of visiting each element in a two-dimensional array (matrix) in a specific order. There are various ways to traverse a matrix, each with its own pattern and use cases.

**Common Traversal Patterns:**

1.  **Row-Major Order:**  Traverse the matrix row by row, from left to right within each row, and from the top row to the bottom row. This is the most common and natural way to traverse a matrix.

2.  **Column-Major Order:** Traverse the matrix column by column, from top to bottom within each column, and from the leftmost column to the rightmost column.

3.  **Diagonal Order:** Traverse the matrix along diagonals. There are two main types:
    *   **Top-Left to Bottom-Right Diagonals:** Start from the top-left corner and move diagonally downwards and to the right.
    *   **Top-Right to Bottom-Left Diagonals:** Start from the top-right corner and move diagonally downwards and to the left.

4.  **Spiral Order:** Traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern, starting from the outer layer and moving inwards.  This is the pattern used in LeetCode problem 54.

5.  **Boundary Traversal:** Visit only the elements on the boundary of the matrix.

6. **Custom Traversal:** Specific problems might require custom traversal patterns based on given constraints or rules.

**Techniques for Traversal:**

*   **Nested Loops:** The most common technique for row-major and column-major order. Use nested `for` loops to iterate through rows and columns.
*   **Boundary Tracking:** For spiral order, keep track of the boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) of the untraversed portion of the matrix and update them as you traverse.
*   **Direction Vectors:** For diagonal or custom traversals, use direction vectors (e.g., `dx`, `dy`) to represent the movement at each step.
*   **Recursion:** Some traversal patterns, like certain diagonal traversals, can be implemented recursively.
