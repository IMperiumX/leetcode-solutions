```markdown
# 139. Word Break, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 300
1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of wordDict are unique.

## Approach(es)

### Dynamic Programming

Algorithm:

1.  Create a boolean array `dp` of size `len(s) + 1`. `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[:i]` can be segmented.
2.  Initialize `dp[0] = True` because an empty string can always be segmented.
3.  Iterate from `i = 1` to `len(s)`:
    *   Iterate from `j = 0` to `i - 1`:
        *   If `dp[j]` is `True` (meaning `s[:j]` is segmentable) and `s[j:i]` is in the `wordDict`, then set `dp[i] = True`.
        *  Break inner loop if `dp[i]` become `True`
4.  Return `dp[len(s)]`.

Data Structures:

*   `dp` array (boolean array)
*   `wordDict` converted to a set for efficient lookup.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n^2 * m), where n is the length of `s` and `m` is the average length of the words in `wordDict`. Checking if `s[j:i]` is in `wordDict` takes O(m) on average with a set.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) for the `dp` array.

Trade-offs:

*   Dynamic programming provides a bottom-up approach, building solutions for smaller substrings to solve the larger problem.

### Recursive with Memoization
Algorithm:

1. Convert wordDict into set word_set
2. Create a dictionary `memo` for storing the result for each start index of the substring of `s`
3. Create helper function `can_break` that take `start_index` as an input
   - Base cases:
    - if `start_index` equal to length of `s` that's mean we reach the end of the string and we found a valid segmentation so return `True`
    - if the `start_index` is already calculated just return `memo[start_index]`
   - Recursive step:
    - Loop through each possible end index and check:
      - if the substring from `start_index` to `end_index` is in our `word_set` and the rest of the string from `end_index` can be broken recursively then we store `True` in `memo[start_index]` and return `True`
      - if the loop finishes without finding solution set `memo[start_index]` to `False` and return `False`
4- Call can_break with initial index = 0

Data Structures:

*   `memo` dictionary (stores results of subproblems)
*   `word_set` converted from `wordDict` for efficient lookup.

Time Complexity:

*  O(n^2 * m) worst case, where `n` is the length of the string and `m` length of the substring, but with memoization repeated calculation are avoided.

Space Complexity:
* O(n) for the recursion and memo.

Trade-offs:
- Top down approach, it's generally easier to understand but less performant than DP.
- Avoid recalculating same sub problems due to memoization.

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

## Key Concepts

*   **Overlapping Subproblems:**  The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems, and these subproblems are reused multiple times.
*   **Optimal Substructure:**  The optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

## Approaches to Dynamic Programming

There are two main approaches to dynamic programming:

1.  **Top-Down (Memoization):**
    *   Start with the original problem and recursively break it down into subproblems.
    *   Store the solutions to subproblems in a cache (usually a dictionary or array).
    *   Before solving a subproblem, check if its solution is already in the cache. If so, reuse the cached solution; otherwise, compute the solution and store it in the cache.
    *   This approach is often implemented using recursion with a memoization table.

2.  **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):**
    *   Start with the smallest subproblems and solve them first.
    *   Store the solutions to subproblems in a table (usually an array).
    *   Build up solutions to larger subproblems by using the solutions of smaller subproblems already stored in the table.
    *   This approach is typically implemented using iteration (loops).

## When to Use Dynamic Programming

Consider using dynamic programming when:

*   The problem exhibits overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
*   You need to find an optimal solution (e.g., minimum, maximum, shortest path, longest subsequence).
*   Brute-force (exhaustive search) is too slow.

## Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a problem that can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming.  The sequence is defined as follows:

*   F(0) = 0
*   F(1) = 1
*   F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

A naive recursive implementation would have exponential time complexity due to redundant calculations.

**Memoization (Top-Down):**

```python
def fib_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fib_memo(n - 1, memo) + fib_memo(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

**Tabulation (Bottom-Up):**

```python
def fib_tab(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```
Both memoization and tabulation reduce the time complexity to O(n) and space complexity to O(n).

## Common DP Problems
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Coin Change
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Shortest Common Supersequence
- Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) - often solved with DP + bitmasking

# String Manipulation
String manipulation refers to the process of modifying, analyzing, and working with strings. Strings are sequences of characters, and they are a fundamental data type in most programming languages.

## Common String Operations

*   **Concatenation:** Combining two or more strings into a single string.  In Python, this is done using the `+` operator.
*   **Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a string (a substring).  Python uses the `[start:end:step]` notation for slicing.
*   **Length:** Finding the number of characters in a string.  In Python, the `len()` function is used.
*   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a substring within a string. Python's `find()`, `index()`, `count()`, and `in` operator are used for searching.
*   **Replacing:** Substituting parts of a string with another string. Python's `replace()` method is used for this.
*   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.  Python's `split()` method is used.
*   **Joining:** Combining a list of strings into a single string, using a separator. Python's `join()` method is used.
*   **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of characters in a string (e.g., uppercase to lowercase). Python's `lower()`, `upper()`, `capitalize()`, `title()`, and `swapcase()` methods are used.
*   **Stripping:** Removing leading and trailing whitespace (or other specified characters) from a string. Python's `strip()`, `lstrip()`, and `rstrip()` methods are used.
*   **Formatting:** Creating strings with embedded values.  Python offers various formatting techniques, including f-strings, the `format()` method, and the `%` operator.
*   **Checking Properties:**  Determining if a string has certain characteristics (e.g., starts with a prefix, ends with a suffix, contains only digits).  Python's `startswith()`, `endswith()`, `isdigit()`, `isalpha()`, `isalnum()`, `islower()`, `isupper()`, etc., methods are used.

## Immutability of Strings (in Python and many other languages)

In Python (and many other languages like Java and JavaScript), strings are *immutable*. This means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed directly.  Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a *new* string object.

```python
s = "hello"
s[0] = "H"  # This will raise a TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

s = s.upper()  # This creates a *new* string "HELLO" and assigns it to s
print(s)  # Output: HELLO
```
