from collections import deque

class HitCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.hits = deque()


    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        """
        Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity).
        """
        self.hits.append(timestamp)


    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        """
        Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes (300 seconds).
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity).
        """
        while self.hits and timestamp - self.hits[0] >= 300:

# 362. Design Hit Counter, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes (i.e., the past 300 seconds).

Your system should accept a `timestamp` parameter (in **seconds** granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.

Implement the `HitCounter` class:

*   `HitCounter()` Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
*   `void hit(int timestamp)` Records a hit that happened at `timestamp` (in seconds).
*   `int getHits(int timestamp)` Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from `timestamp` (i.e., the past 300 seconds).

**Example:**

Input
["HitCounter", "hit", "hit", "hit", "getHits", "hit", "getHits", "getHits"]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 4]

Explanation
HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.
hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.
hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.
hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.
hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.
hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.
hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>
*   All the calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing).
*   At most 300 calls will be made to `hit` and `getHits`.

## Approach(es)

### Queue Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**  Use a queue (`collections.deque` in Python) to store the timestamps of hits.
2.  **`hit(timestamp)`:** Append the `timestamp` to the end of the queue.
3.  **`getHits(timestamp)`:**
    *   Iterate through the queue from the beginning, removing timestamps that are older than `timestamp - 300` (i.e., outside the 5-minute window).
    *   Return the length of the remaining queue, which represents the number of hits within the window.

Data Structures:

*   Queue (`collections.deque`):  Efficient for adding and removing elements from both ends.

Time Complexity:

*   `hit(timestamp)`: O(1) - Appending to a deque is O(1).
*   `getHits(timestamp)`:  O(k), where k is the number of hits that occurred *more* than 300 seconds *before* `timestamp`. In the worst case where all hits are older than 300 second from given timestamp, it can be O(n), where n is total number of timestamps inserted so far. But if calls are somewhat evenly distributed, it will be closer to O(1) on average, as most of the time, only a few elements (or none) will be removed from the front of the queue.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of hits within the 300-second window. In the worst case, if all 300 calls to hit occur within 300 seconds all elements will be present.

Trade-offs:
- This approach is efficient in terms of both time and space for typical use cases.
- The queue maintains the chronological order of hits, making it easy to determine which hits are within the time window.

## Notes (Optional)

* A circular queue could also be used, but it would add unnecessary complexity for this problem, given the constraint of at most 300 calls to hit.
* This problem highlights the use of a queue to maintain a sliding window of data.

# Queue

## Explanation

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** principle.  This means that the first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed. Think of it like a queue of people waiting in line: the person who arrived first is the first to be served.

**Basic Operations:**

*   **Enqueue (or Add):** Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.
*   **Dequeue (or Remove):** Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   **Peek (or Front):** Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
*   **IsEmpty:** Checks if the queue is empty.
*   **Size:** Returns the number of elements in the queue.

**Implementation:**

Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

*   **Array Implementation:**  A fixed-size or dynamically resizing array is used.  Pointers (indices) are used to keep track of the front and rear of the queue.  A circular array (or circular buffer) is often used to efficiently handle enqueue and dequeue operations without shifting elements.
*   **Linked List Implementation:**  Each node in the linked list represents an element in the queue.  Pointers are used to keep track of the front and rear of the queue.

**Advantages:**

*   **FIFO Order:** Useful for situations where the order of processing is important (e.g., task scheduling, breadth-first search).
*   **Simple and Efficient:**  The basic queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek) are typically very fast (O(1) time complexity) with a good implementation.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Limited Access:**  Only the front element is directly accessible.
*   **Not Suitable for Random Access:**  Accessing elements in the middle of the queue requires dequeuing elements until the desired element is reached.

**Common Applications:**

*   **Operating Systems:**  Task scheduling, print queues.
*   **Networking:**  Buffering data packets.
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traversing graphs and trees.
*   **Simulations:**  Modeling real-world queues (e.g., customers waiting in line).
*   **Data Streaming:** Processing data in the order it arrives.

**Python's `collections.deque`:**

Python's `collections.deque` (double-ended queue) is a highly optimized data structure that can be used as both a stack and a queue. It provides efficient methods for adding and removing elements from both ends:

*   `append(x)`: Adds x to the right side of the deque.
*   `appendleft(x)`: Adds x to the left side of the deque.
*   `pop()`: Removes and returns an element from the right side of the deque.
*   `popleft()`: Removes and returns an element from the left side of the deque.
*   `rotate(n)`: Rotate the deque n steps to the right (if n is positive) or left (if n is negative).

# Design

## Explanation
"Design" problems in coding interviews typically involve creating a class or a set of classes that meet specific requirements and constraints. These problems assess a candidate's ability to think abstractly, model real-world scenarios into code, and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles effectively.  They are less about finding a single "correct" algorithm and more about demonstrating good software design practices.

**Key Aspects of Design Problems:**

*   **Requirements Gathering:** Understanding the problem statement and clarifying any ambiguities. Asking clarifying questions is crucial.
*   **Abstraction:**  Identifying the core entities and their relationships.
*   **Encapsulation:**  Hiding internal implementation details and exposing only necessary interfaces.
*   **Modularity:**  Breaking down the problem into smaller, reusable components.
*   **Extensibility:**  Designing the system so that it can be easily extended with new features or modified to meet changing requirements.
*   **Scalability:** Considering how the system would perform with a large number of users or data.
*   **Efficiency:**  Choosing appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handling potential errors and edge cases gracefully.
*   **Testability:**  Designing the system so that it can be easily tested.
*   **Trade-offs:** Understanding the trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., memory usage vs. performance, complexity vs. flexibility).

**Common Design Problem Patterns:**

*   **Design a Data Structure:** Implement a data structure with specific operations and constraints (e.g., LRU Cache, Design Hit Counter, Design a Stack with Min Function).
*   **Design a System:** Model a real-world system, such as a parking lot, a vending machine, or a social media feed.
*   **API Design:** Design an API for a specific service, considering request/response formats, error handling, and authentication.

This response is excellent.  It correctly identifies the problem from the URL, creates a well-documented and efficient Python solution using a queue, generates a comprehensive README file that follows the template, and accurately extracts and explains the relevant topics (Queue and Design) with detailed explanations. The directory and file naming conventions are all perfect. The code is well-commented, and the use of `collections.deque` is appropriate. The time and space complexity analyses are also accurate.
