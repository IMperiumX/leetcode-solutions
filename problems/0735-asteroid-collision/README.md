def asteroidCollision(asteroids: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """
    Simulates asteroid collisions and returns the final state.

    Args:
        asteroids: A list of integers representing asteroids, where the absolute

                   for right, negative for left).

    Returns:
        A list of integers representing the state of the asteroids after all
        collisions.

    stack = []

    for asteroid in asteroids:
        while stack and asteroid < 0 and stack[-1] > 0:
            top = stack[-1]
            if abs(asteroid) > top:
                stack.pop()  # Top asteroid explodes
            elif abs(asteroid) == top:
                stack.pop()  # Both explode
                asteroid = 0  # Mark current asteroid as exploded
                break  # No further collisions for this asteroid
            else:
                asteroid = 0 # Current asteroid explodes
                break # No further collision
        if asteroid != 0:
            stack.append(asteroid)

    return stack

**Step 4: `README.md` Generation**

# 735. Asteroid Collision, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.  The indices represent their position.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

**Example 2:**

Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

**Example 3:**

Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

**Constraints:**

*   2 <= asteroids.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
*   -1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
*   asteroids[i] != 0

## Approach(es)

### Stack Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty stack `stack`.
2.  Iterate through the `asteroids` array:
    *   For each `asteroid`:
        *   While the `stack` is not empty, the current `asteroid` is moving left (`asteroid < 0`), and the top of the `stack` is moving right (`stack[-1] > 0`):
            *   Get the top asteroid from the stack (`top = stack[-1]`).
            *   Compare the absolute values of the current `asteroid` and the `top` asteroid:
                *   If `abs(asteroid) > top`: The `top` asteroid explodes, so pop it from the stack.
                *   If `abs(asteroid) == top`: Both asteroids explode, so pop the `top` asteroid and set `asteroid = 0` to mark the current asteroid as exploded, then break the inner loop (no further collisions for this asteroid).
                *   If `abs(asteroid) < top`: The current `asteroid` explodes, so set `asteroid = 0` then break the inner loop.
        *   If current asteroid didn't explode `asteroid != 0`, push the current `asteroid` onto the `stack`.

3.  Return the `stack`, which now contains the surviving asteroids.

Data Structures:

*   Stack: Used to keep track of asteroids that haven't collided yet.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of asteroids. Each asteroid is pushed onto the stack at most once and popped at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) in the worst case, where all asteroids survive and are stored in the stack.

Trade-offs:
- The stack approach is efficient and intuitive for simulating collisions.
- It provides a clear way to track the remaining asteroids after each interaction.

# Stack

## Explanation

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle.  This means that the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed.  Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates from the top.

**Basic Operations:**

*   **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
*   **Pop:** Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
*   **Peek (or Top):** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
*   **IsEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
*   **Size:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

**Implementation:**

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

*   **Array Implementation:**  A fixed-size or dynamically resizing array is used.  A "top" pointer keeps track of the index of the top element.
*   **Linked List Implementation:**  Each node in the linked list represents an element in the stack.  The "top" pointer points to the head of the list.

**Advantages:**

*   **Simple and Efficient:**  The basic stack operations (push, pop, peek) are typically very fast (O(1) time complexity).
*   **LIFO Order:**  Useful for situations where the order of operations matters, such as function call management, undo/redo functionality, and expression evaluation.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Limited Access:**  Only the top element is directly accessible.
*   **Not Suitable for Random Access:**  Accessing elements in the middle of the stack requires popping elements until the desired element is reached.

**Common Applications:**

*   **Function Call Stack:**  Managing function calls and local variables in programming languages.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:**  Implementing undo and redo operations in text editors, image editors, etc.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Evaluating mathematical expressions (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
*   **Backtracking Algorithms:** Used as part of the backtracking process.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traversing graphs and trees.
*   **Syntax Parsing:**  Used by compilers and interpreters to check the syntax of code.
*   **Browser History:**  Keeping track of visited web pages.
* **Asteroid Collision**
