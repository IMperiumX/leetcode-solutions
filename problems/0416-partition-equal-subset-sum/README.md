Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for problem 416, "Partition Equal Subset Sum."

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

The input clearly defines:

*   **Problem Number:** 416
*   **Problem Name:** Partition Equal Subset Sum
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0416-partition-equal-subset-sum`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since the user didn't provide a solution, we'll generate solutions in Python.  We'll implement both a recursive solution with memoization (top-down dynamic programming) and an iterative solution (bottom-up dynamic programming).

```python
# 0416. Partition Equal Subset Sum - Recursive with Memoization (Top-Down DP)

def canPartition(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False  # Cannot partition if the sum is odd

    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    memo = {}  # (index, current_sum) -> boolean

    def can_partition_recursive(index, current_sum):
        if (index, current_sum) in memo:
            return memo[(index, current_sum)]

        if current_sum == target_sum:
            return True
        if current_sum > target_sum or index >= len(nums):
            return False

        # Include the current number or exclude it
        result = (can_partition_recursive(index + 1, current_sum + nums[index]) or
                  can_partition_recursive(index + 1, current_sum))

        memo[(index, current_sum)] = result
        return result

    return can_partition_recursive(0, 0)
```

This code is saved as `0416-partition-equal-subset-sum/solution_recursive.py`.

```python
# 0416. Partition Equal Subset Sum - Iterative (Bottom-Up DP)

def canPartition(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False  # Odd sum cannot be partitioned

    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [[False] * (target_sum + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Initialize the first column to True (sum of 0 is always possible)
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = True

    # Iterate through the numbers and possible sums
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, target_sum + 1):
            if nums[i - 1] <= j:
                # We can either include the current number or exclude it
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]] or dp[i - 1][j]
            else:
                # We cannot include the current number
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]

    return dp[n][target_sum]
```
This solution will be saved as `0416-partition-equal-subset-sum/solution_iterative.py`.

Here's an optimized version of the iterative solution, using only 1D DP array for better space complexity:
```python
# 0416. Partition Equal Subset Sum - Iterative (Bottom-Up DP, Optimized Space)

def canPartition(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False

    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    dp = [False] * (target_sum + 1)
    dp[0] = True  # A sum of 0 is always possible

    for num in nums:
        for j in range(target_sum, num - 1, -1):  # Iterate backwards
            dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - num]

    return dp[target_sum]

```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

Here's the `README.md` content:

# 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Approach(es)

### Recursive with Memoization (Top-Down DP)

The problem can be solved recursively by considering each number in the array and deciding whether to include it in the current subset or not.  We can use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Check for Odd Sum:** If the sum of all numbers in `nums` is odd, it's impossible to partition the array into two equal subsets. Return `False`.
2.  **Calculate Target Sum:** Calculate the target sum, which is half of the total sum.
3.  **Memoization:** Create a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems. The key is a tuple `(index, current_sum)`, and the value is a boolean indicating whether a partition is possible.
4.  **Recursive Function `can_partition_recursive(index, current_sum)`:**
    *   **Base Cases:**
        *   If `(index, current_sum)` is in `memo`, return the stored value.
        *   If `current_sum == target_sum`, return `True` (a valid partition is found).
        *   If `current_sum > target_sum` or `index >= len(nums)`, return `False` (invalid state).
    *   **Recursive Step:**
        *   Calculate the result by recursively calling the function with and without including the current number:
            ```
            result = (can_partition_recursive(index + 1, current_sum + nums[index]) or  # Include
                      can_partition_recursive(index + 1, current_sum))              # Exclude
            ```
        *   Store the `result` in `memo` and return it.
5.  **Initial Call:**  Call `can_partition_recursive(0, 0)` to start the process.

**Data Structures:**

*   Dictionary (`memo`): For memoization.

**Time Complexity:** O(n\*target_sum), where n is the length of `nums`.
**Space Complexity:** O(n\*target_sum) for the memoization dictionary and the recursion call stack.

### Iterative (Bottom-Up DP)

We can also solve this problem iteratively using a 2D DP table. `dp[i][j]` represents whether a subset with sum `j` can be formed using the first `i` numbers.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Check for Odd Sum:** Same as in the recursive approach.
2.  **Calculate Target Sum:** Same as in the recursive approach.
3.  **DP Table:** Create a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `(n + 1) x (target_sum + 1)`.
4.  **Initialization:**
    *   Set `dp[i][0] = True` for all `i` (a subset with sum 0 is always possible).
5.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the `dp` table:
    *   For `i` from 1 to `n + 1`:
        *   For `j` from 1 to `target_sum + 1`:
            *   If `nums[i - 1] <= j`:
                `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]] or dp[i - 1][j]` (include or exclude).
            *   Else:
                `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]` (exclude).
6.  **Result:** Return `dp[n][target_sum]`.

**Data Structures:**

*    2D boolean array (`dp`).

**Time Complexity:** O(n\*target_sum).
**Space Complexity:** O(n\*target_sum).

### Iterative (Bottom-Up DP, Optimized Space)

We can optimize the space complexity of the iterative approach to O(target_sum) by using a 1D DP array.  The key idea is to iterate through the possible sums *backwards* to avoid overwriting values that are needed in the current iteration.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Check for Odd Sum:**  Same as before.
2.  **Calculate Target Sum:** Same as before.
3.  **1D DP Array:** Create a 1D boolean array `dp` of size `target_sum + 1`.
4.  **Initialization:** Set `dp[0] = True`.
5.  **Iteration:**
    *   Iterate through the `nums` array:
        *   For each `num` in `nums`:
            *   Iterate backwards through the `dp` array, from `target_sum` down to `num`:
                *   `dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - num]`

6.  **Result:** Return `dp[target_sum]`.

**Data Structures:**

*   1D boolean array (`dp`).

**Time Complexity:** O(n\*target_sum).
**Space Complexity:** O(target_sum).

[Iterative (Bottom-Up DP, Optimized Space)](./solution_iterative_optimized.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The problem is a classic example of the 0/1 knapsack problem.
*   The space-optimized iterative solution is generally preferred due to its lower space complexity.
*   The time complexity depends on the `target_sum`, which can be significant if the numbers in `nums` are large. However, given the problem constraint (`1 <= nums[i] <= 100`), the time complexity is pseudo-polynomial.

**Step 5: Topics Extraction**

Since we used Dynamic Programming to solve it. The `Dynamic Programming.md` file will be added.
```markdown
# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations. It's particularly well-suited for problems that exhibit the following properties:

*   **Optimal Substructure:**  An optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
*   **Overlapping Subproblems:**  The same subproblems are encountered multiple times during the recursive solution of the problem.

## Key Concepts

*   **Memoization (Top-Down DP):**  This approach involves writing a recursive function to solve the problem, but storing the results of each subproblem in a table (usually a hash table or array) as they are computed.  Before making a recursive call, the function checks if the solution to that subproblem is already available in the table. This avoids recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.
*   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP):** This approach involves building a table (usually an array) iteratively, starting from the smallest subproblems and working your way up to the main problem.  You fill the table in a specific order, ensuring that the solutions to all required subproblems are available when needed.
*   **State:** The "state" in DP represents the parameters that define a subproblem.  For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, the state is simply the index `n`.  In the knapsack problem, the state might be `(index, remaining_capacity)`.  Choosing the right state is crucial for designing a DP solution.
*   **Recurrence Relation:** A recurrence relation is a mathematical equation that defines the relationship between the solution to a subproblem and the solutions to its smaller subproblems. This is the core logic of a DP solution.
* **Base Case(s)**: The base cases define the solutions to the smallest subproblems, which can be solved directly without further recursion or iteration.

| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approach          | Recursive                                                                                                                                                  | Iterative                                                                                                                                         |
| Implementation    | Start with the main problem and recursively break it down. Store results in a memoization table.                                                             | Start with the smallest subproblems and build up the solution iteratively. Store results in a tabulation table.                                     |
| Ease of Coding   | Often easier to code, as it follows the natural recursive structure of the problem.                                                                       | Can be slightly more complex to code initially, as you need to determine the correct order to fill the table.                                     |
| Space Complexity  | Can use more space due to the recursion call stack, in addition to the memoization table.                                                                    | Generally more space-efficient, as it avoids the recursion call stack.  Space optimization techniques are often easier to apply.                  |
| Time Complexity   | Usually the same as bottom-up (O(number of subproblems \* time per subproblem)).

Can be slightly faster due to the lack of function call overhead.                                               |
| Subproblem Order | Solves subproblems as needed (on demand).                                                                                                                   | Solves all subproblems, even if some are not needed for the final solution.                                                                       |
| Debugging         | Can be harder to debug due to the recursive calls.                                                                                                            | Easier to debug due to the iterative, step-by-step nature.                                                                                    |
| Intuitiveness    | Often more intuitive for problems that have a natural recursive structure.                                                                                | Can be more intuitive for problems where you can easily visualize the dependencies between subproblems and build the solution in a bottom-up fashion. |
## When to Use Dynamic Programming

1.  **Optimization Problems:** DP is primarily used for optimization problems (finding the minimum, maximum, longest, shortest, etc.).
2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:**  Look for problems where the same subproblems are solved repeatedly.  If you draw a recursion tree and see the same subproblems appearing multiple times, DP is likely a good candidate.
3.  **Optimal Substructure:**  Verify that the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

## Common DP Patterns

*   **0/1 Knapsack:**  Deciding whether to include or exclude each item in a set to maximize value within a given capacity.
*   **Unbounded Knapsack:** Similar to 0/1 knapsack, but you can include multiple copies of each item.
*   **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**  Finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
*   **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**  Finding the longest increasing subsequence within a given sequence.
*   **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance):**  Finding the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to transform one string into another.
*   **Fibonacci Sequence:**  A classic (though simple) example of DP.
*   **Coin Change:**  Finding the minimum number of coins to make a given amount.
*   **Matrix Chain Multiplication:**  Finding the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices.
* **Partition Problem**: Check if an array can be partitioned into two subsets of equal sum.

## Tips for LeetCode DP Problems

1.  **Identify the State:**  Determine what parameters define a subproblem.
2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**  Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems.
3.  **Define the Base Cases:**  Identify the smallest subproblems that can be solved directly.
4.  **Choose Top-Down or Bottom-Up:** Decide whether to use memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up).  Consider the trade-offs.
5.  **Optimize Space:**  See if you can reduce the space complexity by using a smaller DP table (e.g., 1D instead of 2D) or by reusing space.
6.  **Practice:**  DP takes practice!  Work through many examples to develop your intuition.

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that is essential for solving many challenging problems on LeetCode and in other areas of computer science.
