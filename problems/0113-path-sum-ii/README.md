Okay, let's break down this task and generate the LeetCode solution repository.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

The input is:

```
113. Path Sum II
Medium
... (rest of the problem description) ...
```

From this, we can identify:

*   **Problem Number:** 113
*   **Problem Name:** Path Sum II
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0113-path-sum-ii`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since no solution code was provided, we'll generate a Python solution using a recursive (Depth-First Search) approach.  We'll create `solution_recursive.py` inside the `0113-path-sum-ii` directory.

```python
# 0113. Path Sum II - Recursive Approach

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pathSum(root: TreeNode, targetSum: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Finds all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree that sum to targetSum.

    Args:
        root: The root of the binary tree.
        targetSum: The target sum.

    Returns:
        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a path.
    """
    result = []

    def dfs(node, current_path, current_sum):
        if not node:
            return

        current_path.append(node.val)
        current_sum += node.val

        if not node.left and not node.right and current_sum == targetSum:
            result.append(current_path.copy())  # Append a *copy* to avoid modification

        dfs(node.left, current_path, current_sum)
        dfs(node.right, current_path, current_sum)

        current_path.pop()  # Backtrack: Remove the last node for exploring other paths

    dfs(root, [], 0)
    return result

```

**Step 4: README.md Generation**

We'll create `README.md` inside the `0113-path-sum-ii` directory.

# 113. Path Sum II, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []

**Example 3:**

Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: []

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

## Approach(es)

### Recursive Approach (Depth-First Search)

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Base Case:** If the current node is `None`, return.
2.  **Add to Path:** Add the current node's value to the `current_path` list and update the `current_sum`.
3.  **Leaf Check:** If the current node is a leaf node (no left or right children) and the `current_sum` equals `targetSum`, add a *copy* of the `current_path` to the `result` list.  We use `current_path.copy()` because `current_path` is modified during the recursion.
4.  **Recursive Calls:** Recursively call the DFS function on the left and right children.
5.  **Backtrack:** After exploring the left and right subtrees, remove the current node's value from the `current_path` (backtracking) to prepare for exploring other paths.

**Data Structures:**

*   List (`current_path`): To store the current path being explored.
*   List of Lists (`result`): To store all valid paths.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  In the worst case, we visit each node once.
*    In the best-case scenario (perfectly balanced tree), it still visits all nodes, so the complexity remains O(N).
*    The copy operation inside the leaf check node, if the current sum equals the target, makes the overall complexity to be O(N^2).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity. In the best case (a balanced tree), H is log(N), resulting in O(log N) space complexity.
*   The `current_path` can be at most the size of the height so it takes `O(H)`
*   The output `result` can contain at most N/2 Leafs (in a complete binary tree), each with at most H nodes which makes overall complexity O(N*H)

**Trade-offs:**

*   This recursive approach is relatively easy to understand and implement.
*   The space complexity depends on the height of the tree, which can be O(N) in the worst-case scenario of a skewed tree.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The related topics for this problem are:

1.  **Tree:**  The problem fundamentally deals with a binary tree data structure.
2.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** The most common and efficient approach to solve this problem is DFS.
3.  **Recursion:**  DFS is naturally implemented using recursion.
4. **Backtracking:** Backtracking is essential part of DFS to handle the paths.

We create separate files for each of these: `Tree.md`, `Depth-First Search.md`,`Recursion.md`, `Backtracking.md`.

**Tree.md:**

```markdown
# Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.  It is a non-linear data structure, unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.  A tree has the following general properties:

*   **Root:** The topmost node in the tree.
*   **Parent:** A node that has child nodes.
*   **Child:** A node that has a parent node.
*   **Leaf:** A node that has no children.
*   **Edge:** The connection between two nodes.
*   **Depth:** The length of the path from the root to a node.
*   **Height:** The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf.

**Binary Tree:**

A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the *left child* and the *right child*.  Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for various applications, including:

*   **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):**  Used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data.
*   **Expression Trees:** Used to represent mathematical expressions.
*   **Huffman Coding Trees:** Used for data compression.
* **Tries** Used for efficeint prefix search
* **Syntax Trees** Used in compilers and interpreters.

**Tree Traversals:**

There are several ways to traverse a tree (visit all the nodes in a specific order):

*   **Preorder Traversal:** Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
*   **Inorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree (gives sorted order for BSTs).
*   **Postorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
*   **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search):** Visit nodes level by level, from left to right.

**Depth-First Search.md:**

```markdown
# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Start:** Begin at the root node (or a selected starting node).
2.  **Explore:**  Visit the current node.
3.  **Recurse:** For each unvisited neighbor of the current node, recursively call the DFS function on that neighbor.
4.  **Backtrack:**  When all neighbors of a node have been visited, return to the previous node (backtrack).

**Implementation:**

DFS is typically implemented using recursion. A stack data structure is implicitly used via the function call stack.  An iterative implementation using an explicit stack is also possible.

**Applications:**

*   **Finding connected components in a graph.**
*   **Topological sorting.**
*   **Detecting cycles in a graph.**
*   **Solving puzzles with only one solution (e.g., mazes).**
*   **Pathfinding (finding all paths or a specific path).**

**Recursion.md:**

```markdown
# Recursion

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition.  It's a way to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

**Key Components of a Recursive Function:**

1.  **Base Case(s):**  The condition(s) that stop the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
2.  **Recursive Step:** The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case.

**Example (Factorial):**

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base Case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive Step: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

**Advantages of Recursion:**

*   **Elegance and Readability:**  Recursive solutions can often be more concise and easier to understand than iterative solutions, especially for problems with a naturally recursive structure (e.g., tree traversals).
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Recursion naturally breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.

**Disadvantages of Recursion:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** Excessive recursion can lead to a stack overflow error if the recursion depth exceeds the stack limit.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Function calls can have some overhead, so deeply recursive functions might be slightly slower than iterative solutions.  However, compiler optimizations can often mitigate this.
* **Space Complexity** Takes more space than iteration due to call stack.

**Backtracking.md:**

```markdown
# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Candidate Solutions:**  Partial solutions that are built incrementally.
*   **Constraints:** Rules that define valid solutions.
*   **Incremental Building:**  Solutions are built step-by-step.
*   **Abandonment:**  If a partial solution violates the constraints, it's abandoned, and the algorithm backtracks to a previous state.

**Algorithm (General Structure):**

1.  **Start:** Begin with an empty candidate solution.
2.  **Choice:**  Make a choice to extend the current candidate solution (e.g., add an element, move in a certain direction).
3.  **Constraint Check:**  Check if the extended candidate solution satisfies the constraints.
4.  **Recursive Call (if valid):** If the constraints are satisfied, recursively call the backtracking function with the extended candidate solution.
5.  **Backtrack (if invalid or solution found):** If the constraints are violated, or a complete solution is found, undo the last choice (backtrack) and try a different choice.

**Applications:**

*   **N-Queens Problem:** Placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
*   **Sudoku Solver:** Filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
*   **Maze Solving:** Finding a path through a maze.
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:** Finding the best solution from a set of possible solutions.
*  **Subset Problems.**
