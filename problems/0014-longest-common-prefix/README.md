Okay, let's create the solution, README, and topic files for the "Longest Common Prefix" problem (LeetCode #14).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 14
*   **Problem Name:** Longest Common Prefix
*   **Difficulty:** Easy

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

I will create a folder named `0014-longest-common-prefix`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

There are several ways to approach this. Here are three common, efficient solutions:

1.  **Horizontal Scanning:** Iterate through the characters of the first string, comparing each character to the corresponding character in all other strings.
2.  **Vertical Scanning:** Iterate through the strings, comparing characters at the same index across all strings.
3. **Using `zip`:** Python's `zip` function can elegantly handle the vertical scanning.

I'll provide solutions for all three.

*   **File 1: `solution_horizontal.py`**

```python
"""
Longest Common Prefix - Horizontal Scanning
"""

def longestCommonPrefix_horizontal(strs: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Finds the longest common prefix using horizontal scanning.

    Args:
      strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
      The longest common prefix string.
    """
    if not strs:
        return ""

    prefix = strs[0]
    for s in strs[1:]:
        i = 0
        while i < len(prefix) and i < len(s) and prefix[i] == s[i]:
            i += 1
        prefix = prefix[:i]  # Trim the prefix to the common part

    return prefix
```

*   **File 2: `solution_vertical.py`**

```python
"""
Longest Common Prefix - Vertical Scanning
"""

def longestCommonPrefix_vertical(strs: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Finds the longest common prefix using vertical scanning.

    Args:
      strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
      The longest common prefix string.
    """
    if not strs:
        return ""

    for i in range(len(strs[0])):  # Iterate through characters of the first string
        char = strs[0][i]
        for j in range(1, len(strs)):  # Iterate through the other strings
            if i == len(strs[j]) or strs[j][i] != char:
                return strs[0][:i]  # Return the prefix up to this point

    return strs[0]  # The first string is the common prefix
```

*   **File 3: `solution_zip.py`**

```python
"""
Longest Common Prefix - Using zip
"""

def longestCommonPrefix_zip(strs: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Finds the longest common prefix using zip.

    Args:
      strs: A list of strings.

    Returns:
      The longest common prefix string.
    """
    if not strs:
        return ""

    prefix = ""
    for chars in zip(*strs):  # zip groups characters at the same index
        if len(set(chars)) == 1:  # Check if all characters are the same
            prefix += chars[0]
        else:
            break

    return prefix
```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

**File: `README.md`**

```markdown
# 14. Longest Common Prefix, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
-   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
-   `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters (if non-empty).

## Approach(es)

### Horizontal Scanning

**Algorithm:**

1.  Initialize `prefix` to the first string in `strs`.
2.  Iterate through the remaining strings in `strs`:
    -   Compare characters of `prefix` and the current string `s` until a mismatch is found or one of the strings ends.
    -   Update `prefix` to be the common part found so far.
3.  Return `prefix`.

**Data Structures:**

-   Strings

**Time Complexity:**

-   O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In the worst case, we might compare all characters.

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(1) - Constant extra space.

**Trade-offs:**

-   Simple to understand.
-   Can be less efficient than vertical scanning if there's a very short string early on.

### Vertical Scanning

**Algorithm:**

1.  Iterate through the characters of the *first* string in `strs`.
2.  For each character, iterate through the *other* strings in `strs`:
    -   If the current string is shorter than the current index or the characters don't match, return the prefix found so far (up to the current index).
3.  If all characters of the first string are common prefixes, return the first string.

**Data Structures:**

- Strings

**Time Complexity:**

-   O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.  In the worst case, we compare all characters.
-   In the *best* case (a short string with no common prefix), it can be much faster than horizontal scanning.

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(1) - Constant extra space.

**Trade-offs:**

-   Can be more efficient than horizontal scanning in some cases (especially if there's a short string with no common prefix).

### Using `zip`

**Algorithm:**

1. Use `zip(*strs)` to group characters at the same index from all strings.
2. Iterate through the groups of characters created by `zip`:
    - If all characters in the group are the same (use `set` to check), append the character to the `prefix`.
    - Otherwise, break the loop.
3. Return the `prefix`.

**Data Structures:**
- Strings

**Time Complexity:**

- O(S), same reasoning as Vertical Scanning
    
**Space Complexity:**

- O(1) - the `set` we create has a max size of 26, so it's a constant.

**Trade-offs:**

-   Very concise and Pythonic.
-   Leverages the power of `zip` for elegant iteration.
-   Easily readable

[Vertical Scanning](./solution_vertical.py)
[Using zip](./solution_zip.py)

## Notes

- This problem is a classic string manipulation problem.
- The vertical scanning and `zip` approaches are generally preferred for their potential efficiency and readability.
- The horizontal scanning approach is a good starting point for understanding the problem.
- The problem highlights the importance of considering edge cases (e.g., empty input list, empty strings).

**Topic Extraction and Files:**

*   **Strings.md:** (This file has been created in previous problems, and it can be reused here.  No significant additions are needed for this specific problem.)

The `0014-longest-common-prefix` folder is now complete, containing three solution files (horizontal scanning, vertical scanning, and using `zip`), a detailed README explaining the problem and the different approaches, and a reference to the relevant Strings topic file. This provides a comprehensive and well-organized resource for understanding the problem and its solutions.
