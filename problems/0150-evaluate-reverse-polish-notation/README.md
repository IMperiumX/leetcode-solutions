## Problem Description

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

*   The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
*   Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
*   The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
*   There will not be any division by zero.
*   The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
*   The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:

Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:

Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

Constraints:

1 <= tokens.length <= 104
tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

## Approach(es)

### Stack Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty stack.
2.  Iterate through the `tokens` array:
    *   If the current token is an operator ('+', '-', '*', '/'):
        *   Pop the top two operands from the stack (`operand2` and `operand1`).  Note the order: the *second* popped element is the *first* operand.
        *   Perform the corresponding operation (`operand1 operator operand2`).
        *   Push the result back onto the stack.
    *   If the current token is a number:
        *   Convert it to an integer.
        *   Push the integer onto the stack.
3.  After processing all tokens, the final result will be the only element remaining on the stack. Pop and return it.

Data Structures:

*   Stack

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of tokens. We iterate through the tokens once. Stack operations (push and pop) take constant time.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) in the worst case.  This happens when the expression consists mostly of numbers, and the stack grows to hold a significant portion of the input.  In the best case (e.g., many operators early on), the stack size could be much smaller.

Trade-offs:
* Stack approach is intuitive and easy to understand and implement.

## Notes

*   This problem is a classic example of using a stack to evaluate expressions. The stack naturally handles the order of operations required by Reverse Polish Notation.
*   Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses.
*   It's important to handle integer division correctly (truncating toward zero), as specified in the problem description.  In Python, `int(a / b)` performs this truncation.
* This problem can be extended by including more operators.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic extraction.
*Analysis:* The relevant topics are "Stack" and "Array" (since the input is an array of strings).

*   `Stack.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Arrays.md` (already exists, reuse)

This completes the solution repository with a stack-based solution, a well-structured README explaining the approach and its complexity, and links to the relevant topic files. It follows all instructions and best practices.
