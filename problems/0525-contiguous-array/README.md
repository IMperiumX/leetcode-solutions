                count += 1  # Treat 1 as +1

            if count in count_map:
                max_length = max(max_length, i - count_map[count])  # Update max_length
            else:

    # 525. Contiguous Array, Difficulty: Medium

    ## Problem Description

    Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0,1,0]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

    ## Approach(es)

    ### HashMap Approach

    Algorithm:

    1.  Initialize a dictionary (hash map) `count_map` to store the cumulative count of (1s - 0s) as keys and their corresponding indices as values.  We initialize it with `{0: -1}`.  This handles the case where a subarray starting from the beginning has an equal number of 0s and 1s.
    2.  Initialize `count` to 0, representing the initial balance (equal number of 0s and 1s).
    3.  Initialize `max_length` to 0, to store the maximum length found so far.
    4.  Iterate through the `nums` array using a `for` loop with index `i`.
    5.  For each element `num`:
        *   If `num` is 0, decrement `count` (treat 0 as -1).
        *   If `num` is 1, increment `count` (treat 1 as +1).
    6.  Check if the current `count` already exists as a key in `count_map`:
        *   If it exists, it means that the subarray between the previous occurrence of this `count` and the current index `i` has an equal number of 0s and 1s. Calculate the length of this subarray (`i - count_map[count]`) and update `max_length` if this length is greater.
        *   If it doesn't exist, add the current `count` and its index `i` to `count_map`. This stores the *first* occurrence of this particular count.
    7.  Return `max_length`.

    Data Structures:
    -   HashMap: Used to store the cumulative count and its index.

    Time Complexity:
    -   O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array once.

    Space Complexity:
    -   O(n) in the worst case, as the `count_map` might store up to n distinct counts.  In the best case where all elements are the same, the space complexity would be O(1).

    Trade-offs:
     - Using the HashMap requires extra space but makes the search faster and lead to linear time complexity.

    ## Code

    [HashMap Approach](./solution.py)
     ## Notes (Optional)
      The core idea is to transform the problem of finding equal 0s and 1s into finding a subarray with a sum of 0 (by treating 0s as -1s). The HashMap efficiently tracks the cumulative sums and their indices, allowing us to quickly determine the length of subarrays with a sum of 0.

 # HashMap

 A HashMap (also known as a Hash Table or Dictionary) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.  It uses a hash function to compute an index (hash code) for each key, and this index is used to determine where to store the corresponding value in the underlying data structure (usually an array).

 Key Features:

 -   **Key-Value Pairs:**  Data is stored as pairs of keys and values.
 -   **Unique Keys:**  Keys must be unique within a HashMap.
 -   **Fast Lookups:**  Retrieving a value associated with a key is typically very fast, on average O(1).
 -   **Hashing:**  A hash function is used to map keys to indices.
 -  **No Guaranteed Order:** In general, HashMaps do *not* guarantee any particular order of the key-value pairs.

 Common Operations and Time Complexities (Average Case):

 -   **put(key, value):**  O(1)
 -   **get(key):** O(1)
 -   **remove(key):** O(1)
 -   **containsKey(key):** O(1)
 -   **size():** O(1)

 *Worst-Case Time Complexity:*  In the rare event of hash collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same index), the time complexity for operations like `get`, `put`, and `remove` can degrade to O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements.  However, good hash functions and techniques like chaining or open addressing minimize collisions, making the average case O(1) highly likely.

 Use Cases:

 -   Implementing dictionaries and associative arrays.
 -   Caching (storing and retrieving data quickly).
 -   Counting frequencies of elements.
 -   Representing graphs (adjacency lists).
 -   Any situation where you need fast lookups based on a key.
