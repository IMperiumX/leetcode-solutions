# 211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots '.' where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

Input:
`["WordDictionary","addWord","addWord","addWord","search","search","search","search"]`
`[[],["bad"],["dad"],["mad"],["pad"],["bad"],[".ad"],["b.."]]`
Output:
`[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true]`

Explanation:

```
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord("bad");
wordDictionary.addWord("dad");
wordDictionary.addWord("mad");
wordDictionary.search("pad"); // return False
wordDictionary.search("bad"); // return True
wordDictionary.search(".ad"); // return True
wordDictionary.search("b.."); // return True
```

Constraints:

*   `1 <= word.length <= 25`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of '.' or lowercase English letters.
*   There will be at most 2 dots in `word` for search queries.
*   At most 10^4 calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.

## Approach(es)

### Trie Approach

A Trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings.  It's particularly efficient for searching for strings with a common prefix.  Each node in a Trie represents a character, and the path from the root to a node represents a prefix.  A special flag (e.g., `is_word`) indicates whether a node represents the end of a complete word.

Algorithm:

1.  **TrieNode Class:** Define a `TrieNode` class with:
    *   `children`: A dictionary to store child nodes.  Keys are characters, and values are `TrieNode` objects.
    *   `is_word`: A boolean flag to mark the end of a word.

2.  **WordDictionary Class:**
    *   `__init__`: Initialize the `WordDictionary` with a `root` node (an instance of `TrieNode`).
    *   `addWord(word)`:
        *   Start at the `root` node.
        *   Iterate through the characters of the `word`.
        *   For each character, if it's not already a child of the current node, create a new `TrieNode` for it and add it to the `children` dictionary.
        *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
        *   After processing all characters, set the `is_word` flag of the final node to `True`.
    *   `search(word)`:
        *   Use a recursive helper function `dfs(node, index)` to perform Depth-First Search:
            *   **Base Case (Success):** If `index` reaches the end of the `word`, return `node.is_word` (check if the current node represents a complete word).
            *   **Base Case (Failure):** Implicitly handled within the other cases.
            *   **Wildcard ('.'):** If the character at `word[index]` is '.', iterate through *all* child nodes of the current node and recursively call `dfs` on each child with `index + 1`. If any of these recursive calls return `True`, return `True`.  Otherwise, return `False` after exploring all children.
            *   **Regular Character:** If the character is not a wildcard, check if it exists as a key in the `children` dictionary of the current node. If it doesn't exist, return `False`.  If it exists, recursively call `dfs` on the corresponding child node with `index + 1`.
        *   Call `dfs(self.root, 0)` to start the search from the root node.

Data Structures:

*   Trie (implemented using the `TrieNode` class).

Time Complexity:

*   `addWord`: O(M), where M is the length of the word.
*   `search`:  O(M * 26^D), where D is number of dots. In the worst case where the search word consists entirely of wildcards, we might explore all possible paths in the Trie, so up to 26^D * M, D being num of dots, however worst case cannot exceed total number of nodes, so can be expressed as O(N) as well, where N is the total number of nodes in the Trie.

Space Complexity:

*   O(N), where N is the total number of characters in all added words. This represents the space used to store the Trie nodes.

Trade-offs:

*   The Trie provides efficient search, especially when there are many words with shared prefixes.
*   The space complexity can be higher than a simple list if the words don't share many prefixes.

## Code

[Trie Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes

* The key to solving this problem efficiently is using a Trie. A brute-force approach (e.g., storing words in a list and comparing them directly) would be too slow for the given constraints.
* The recursive `dfs` function is crucial for handling the wildcard '.' character in the `search` method.
* The `is_word` flag in the `TrieNode` is essential for distinguishing between prefixes and complete words.

**Step 5: Topics Extraction**

Create `Trie.md`, `Depth-First Search.md`, and `Design.md`.

Trie.md:
# Trie (Prefix Tree)

A Trie, also known as a prefix tree or digital tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.  Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.  All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.

## Key Concepts

- **Nodes:** Each node (except the root) represents a character in a string.
- **Root:** The top-level node, representing the empty string.
- **Edges:** Connections between nodes, representing transitions between characters.
- **Prefix:** The sequence of characters from the root to a given node.
- **is_word (or similar flag):** A boolean flag at each node indicating whether the path from the root to that node forms a complete word.

## Common Operations

- **insert(word):** Adds a word to the Trie.
- **search(word):** Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
- **startsWith(prefix):** Checks if any word in the Trie starts with the given prefix.
- **delete(word):** (Optional) Removes a word from the Trie. This operation is less common and can be more complex to implement.

## How Tries Work

1.  **Insertion:**
    *   Start at the root node.
    *   For each character in the word:
        *   If the current node has a child with that character, move to the child node.
        *   Otherwise, create a new child node with that character and move to the new child node.
    *   After processing all characters, mark the final node's `is_word` flag as `True`.

2.  **Search:**
    *   Start at the root node.
    *   For each character in the word:
        *   If the current node has a child with that character, move to the child node.
        *   Otherwise, the word is not in the Trie; return `False`.
    *   After processing all characters, check the final node's `is_word` flag.  If it's `True`, the word exists; otherwise, only a prefix exists.

3.  **startsWith:**
    *   Follows the same logic as `search`, but we only need to reach the node corresponding to the last character of the prefix.  We don't need to check the `is_word` flag.

## Advantages

- **Efficient Prefix Operations:**  Tries are highly efficient for operations involving prefixes (e.g., searching for words with a given prefix, autocompletion).
- **Fast Search and Insertion:**  Search and insertion operations have a time complexity proportional to the length of the word (O(M), where M is the word length), independent of the total number of words in the Trie.

## Disadvantages

- **Space Complexity:** Tries can consume significant memory, especially if the words don't share many prefixes. Each node typically stores pointers to its children, which can lead to a large number of nodes.
- **Not Suitable for All String Sets:** If the strings don't share prefixes, a Trie might not be the most space-efficient data structure.

## Use Cases

- **Autocomplete:** Suggesting words as the user types.
- **Spell Checkers:** Identifying misspelled words.
- **IP Routing (Longest Prefix Match):** Finding the longest matching prefix in a routing table.
- **Dictionaries and Lexicons:** Storing and searching for words in a dictionary.
- **T9 Text Prediction:** Predicting words on mobile phone keypads.

# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Key Concepts

- **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a tree or graph.
- **Exploration:**  Following a path as deeply as possible before exploring other paths.
- **Backtracking:**  Returning to a previous node to explore unexplored branches.
- **Stack (or Recursion):**  DFS is typically implemented using a stack (explicitly or implicitly via recursion).
- **Visited Set:**  Used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles (especially in graphs).

## How DFS Works (Recursive Implementation)

1.  **Start:** Begin at the root (or a chosen starting node).
2.  **Mark Visited:** Mark the current node as visited.
3.  **Explore Neighbors:** For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
4.  **Backtrack:**  Once all neighbors have been explored, return to the previous node (this happens automatically with recursion).

## How DFS Works (Iterative Implementation - Using a Stack)

1.  **Start:** Push the root (or starting node) onto a stack.
2.  **Loop:** While the stack is not empty:
    *   **Pop:** Pop a node from the stack.
    *   **Mark Visited:**  If the node has not been visited:
        *   Mark it as visited.
        *   **Push Neighbors:** Push all unvisited neighbors of the popped node onto the stack.

## Advantages

- **Simple Implementation:** Can be implemented concisely using recursion.
- **Memory Efficient (Sometimes):** For trees, DFS can be more memory-efficient than Breadth-First Search (BFS) if the tree is very wide but not very deep.
- **Finds Paths:** Useful for finding paths between nodes.

## Disadvantages

- **Not Guaranteed Shortest Path:**  DFS does not necessarily find the shortest path between two nodes (BFS is better for that).
- **Can Get Stuck in Deep Branches:**  In very deep trees or graphs, DFS might explore a very long path before finding a solution.
- **Stack Overflow (Recursion):**  Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.

## Use Cases

- Traversing trees and graphs.
- Finding connected components in a graph.
- Topological sorting.
- Detecting cycles in a graph.
- Solving puzzles (e.g., mazes).
- String Matching with wildcards

# Design Problems in Coding Interviews

Design problems in coding interviews assess your ability to create a system, algorithm, or data structure to solve a specific problem.  These problems are often open-ended and require you to make design choices, discuss trade-offs, and consider various constraints. They go beyond simply implementing a known algorithm; they test your problem-solving skills, creativity, and understanding of software design principles.

## Key Aspects of Design Problems

- **Understanding Requirements:** Clarifying the problem's scope, constraints, and expected functionality.  Ask clarifying questions!
- **Choosing Data Structures:** Selecting appropriate data structures to efficiently store and manage data.
- **Designing Algorithms:** Developing algorithms to perform the required operations.
- **Considering Trade-offs:**  Evaluating the pros and cons of different design choices (e.g., time complexity, space complexity, scalability, maintainability).
- **Modularity and Abstraction:**  Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable modules and using abstraction to hide implementation details.
- **Scalability:**  Considering how the design would perform with larger inputs or increased load.
- **Error Handling:**  Addressing potential errors and edge cases.
- **Communication:** Clearly explaining your design choices and reasoning to the interviewer.

## Common Types of Design Problems

- **Data Structure Design:** Designing a custom data structure (e.g., a specialized queue, a cache, a rate limiter).
- **System Design:** Designing a larger system (e.g., a URL shortener, a social media feed, a distributed cache).  These are more common in senior-level interviews.
- **API Design:** Designing an API for a specific service or functionality.
- **Algorithm Design:** Designing an algorithm to solve a particular problem (often with specific performance requirements).
- **Object-Oriented Design:**  Designing a set of classes and their interactions to model a real-world scenario.

## Tips for Solving Design Problems

1.  **Clarify Requirements:** Ask questions to fully understand the problem.  Don't make assumptions.
2.  **Start with a High-Level Design:** Describe the overall approach before diving into details.
3.  **Break Down the Problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
4.  **Choose Appropriate Data Structures:** Justify your choices.
5.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Think about potential errors and how to handle them.
6.  **Discuss Trade-offs:**  Explain the advantages and disadvantages of your design choices.
7.  **Iterate and Refine:**  Be prepared to refine your design based on feedback from the interviewer.
8.  **Communicate Clearly:**  Explain your thought process and reasoning throughout the process.
9. **Think about scalability:** How the problem changes if data significantly increases.

## Example Design Considerations
