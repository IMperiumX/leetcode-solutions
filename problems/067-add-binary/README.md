# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation involves working directly with the individual bits of binary numbers. It's a powerful technique used in various computer science applications, including low-level programming, algorithm optimization, and cryptography. Understanding bitwise operators and how to apply them is crucial for efficient problem-solving.

## Basic Bitwise Operators

In most programming languages, the following bitwise operators are available:

*   **AND (`&`):**  Compares corresponding bits of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 & 0 = 0
    0 & 1 = 0
    1 & 0 = 0
    1 & 1 = 1
    ```

*   **OR (`|`):**  If at least one of the corresponding bits is 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 | 0 = 0
    0 | 1 = 1
    1 | 0 = 1
    1 | 1 = 1
    ```

*   **XOR (`^`):**  If the corresponding bits are different, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 ^ 0 = 0
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    1 ^ 1 = 0
    ```

*   **NOT (`~`):**  Flips the bits of a number (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).  Note: In many languages (like Python), `~x` is equivalent to `-x - 1` due to two's complement representation.
    ```
    ~0 = 1
    ~1 = 0
    ```

*   **Left Shift (`<<`):**  Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.  Zeros are filled in on the right.  This is equivalent to multiplying by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
    ```
    x << n  (multiply x by 2^n)
    ```

*   **Right Shift (`>>`):**  Shifts the bits to the right.  For unsigned integers (or non-negative integers), zeros are filled in on the left (logical right shift).  For signed integers, the behavior can be either logical (fill with 0) or arithmetic (fill with the sign bit - preserving the sign), depending on the language and compiler.  This is equivalent to integer division by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
    ```
     x >> n (divide x by 2^n)
    ```

## Common Bit Manipulation Techniques

*   **Checking if a bit is set:** `(x & (1 << n)) != 0`  (Checks if the nth bit of x is 1).
*   **Setting a bit:** `x |= (1 << n)`  (Sets the nth bit of x to 1).
*   **Clearing a bit:** `x &= ~(1 << n)` (Sets the nth bit of x to 0).
*   **Toggling a bit:** `x ^= (1 << n)` (Flips the nth bit of x).
*   **Getting the rightmost set bit:** `x & -x`  (Isolates the rightmost 1 bit. This relies on two's complement representation).
*   **Clearing the rightmost set bit:** `x & (x - 1)`
*   **Counting set bits (Hamming Weight):** Various methods exist, including:
    *   Iterating through bits and checking each one.
    *   Using the `x & (x - 1)` trick repeatedly until x becomes 0.
    *   Using built-in functions (e.g., `bin(x).count('1')` in Python, `__builtin_popcount(x)` in C++).
* **Check if a number is power of two:** `x && !(x & (x-1))`
* **Swap two numbers without temp:**
```python
x ^= y
y ^= x
x ^= y
```

## Advantages of Bit Manipulation

*   **Efficiency:** Bitwise operations are often very fast, as they are directly supported by the processor.
*   **Space Optimization:**  Can represent sets or flags compactly using individual bits within an integer.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Can lead to more efficient algorithms in certain situations.

## Use Cases

*   **Low-Level Programming:**  Interacting with hardware, device drivers, embedded systems.
*   **Cryptography:**  Encryption and decryption algorithms often use bitwise operations.
*   **Graphics:**  Manipulating pixel data.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:**  Solving problems involving subsets, permutations, or specific bit patterns.
*   **Data Compression:**  Some compression techniques rely on bitwise operations.
* **Networking:** Some low level networking staff require bit manipulation

# 67. Add Binary, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
*   `a` and `b` consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
*   Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Approach(es)

### Standard Approach (Simulating Addition)

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize an empty string `result` to store the sum.
    *   Initialize a `carry` variable to 0.
    *   Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the last indices of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate while `i` or `j` is non-negative, or `carry` is 1:
    *   Calculate the `sum_val`: Initialize it to the current `carry`.
    *   If `i` is within bounds, add the integer value of `a[i]` to `sum_val` and decrement `i`.
    *   If `j` is within bounds, add the integer value of `b[j]` to `sum_val` and decrement `j`.
    *   Append the last bit of `sum_val` (which is `sum_val % 2`) to the *beginning* of the `result` string.
    *   Update `carry` to be the carry-over value (which is `sum_val // 2`).
3.  **Return:** Return the `result` string.

Data Structures:

*   String: Used to store the result.

Time Complexity:

*   O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. We iterate at most the length of the longer string.

Space Complexity:

*   O(max(n, m)) - The length of the result string can be at most max(n, m) + 1.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach directly simulates binary addition, making it clear and easy to understand.

### Pythonic Approach (Bit Manipulation)

Algorithm:

1.  **Convert to Integers:** Convert the binary strings `a` and `b` to integers `x` and `y` using `int(a, 2)` and `int(b, 2)`.
2.  **Iterate with XOR and Carry:** While `y` is not zero:
    *   Calculate the `answer` (sum without carry) using XOR: `answer = x ^ y`.
    *   Calculate the `carry` using AND and left shift: `carry = (x & y) << 1`.
    *   Update `x` and `y` for the next iteration: `x = answer`, `y = carry`.
3. **Return:** Return `bin(x)[2:]` to convert the final result `x` back to a binary string (excluding the "0b" prefix).

Data Structures:
* Integers to store and calculate the value.

Time Complexity:

* O(max(N, M)) where N and M is length of a and b.

Space Complexity:
* O(max(N,M)) to store the result.

Trade-offs:
*   This uses bit manipulation for a more concise solution.

## Notes (Optional)

*   The standard approach is generally more intuitive for those unfamiliar with bit manipulation.
*   The Pythonic approach demonstrates how bitwise operations can be used to perform addition.  It leverages the properties of XOR (addition without carry) and AND with left shift (carry generation).
