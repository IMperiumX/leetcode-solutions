Okay, let's create the LeetCode solution repository for the "Cheapest Flights Within K Stops" problem.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 787 (We can get that from searching LeetCode.)
*   **Problem Name:** Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

Create the directory `0787-cheapest-flights-within-k-stops`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

We'll provide solutions using:

1.  **Bellman-Ford:** A classic algorithm for finding shortest paths, well-suited for the "at most K stops" constraint.
2.  **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Modified):**  We'll adapt Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, considering stops.
3.  **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Since we have a limit on the number of stops (edges), a modified BFS can also work efficiently.

# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return *the **cheapest price** from* `src` *to* `dst` *with at most* `k` *stops*. If there is no such route, return -1.

**Example 1:**

Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation: The optimal path with at most 1 stop is 0 -> 1 -> 3, with a total cost of 100 + 600 = 700.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200

**Example 3:**

Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= n <= 100
*   0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
*   flights[i].length == 3
*   0 <= fromi, toi < n
*   fromi != toi
*   1 <= pricei <= 10^4
*   There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
*   0 <= src, dst, k < n
*   src != dst

## Approach(es)

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an array `prices` of size *n*, initialized to infinity, representing the minimum cost to reach each city from the source. Set `prices[src] = 0`.
2.  **Relaxation:** Iterate `k+1` times (because *k* stops mean at most *k+1* edges).  In each iteration:
    *   Create a copy of the `prices` array (`temp_prices`).
    *   Iterate through each flight `[u, v, price]` in `flights`:
        *   If `prices[u]` is not infinity (meaning we can reach city `u`):
            *   Relax the edge: `temp_prices[v] = min(temp_prices[v], prices[u] + price)`.
    *   Update `prices` with `temp_prices`.
3.  **Return:** Return `prices[dst]` if it's not infinity; otherwise, return -1.

**Data Structures:**

*   Array (`prices`): Stores the minimum cost to reach each city.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(K * E), where E is the number of flights (edges). We iterate `k+1` times, and in each iteration, we process all edges.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(N), where N is the number of cities (for the `prices` array).

**Trade-offs:**

*   Bellman-Ford is well-suited for problems with a limited number of edges (or stops, in this case).
*    It can detect negative cycles (though not relevant to this problem, as prices are positive).

### Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Algorithm:**
1.  **Adjacency List:** Build adjacency list.
2.  **Priority Queue:** Create a priority queue that contains the `(cost, city, stops)`.
3. **Iteration:** Pop the element with the minimum cost. If the city is the destination, then return cost. if the number of stops greater than `k`, then ignore this path. else traverse all neighbors and add them to the priority queue.
4. **Return** If there is no path to the distination return -1.

**Data Structures:**

*   Adjacency list.
*   Priority Queue:

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(E log E), where E is the number of flights.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(E + N), where E is the number of edges and N is the number of vertices

**Trade-offs:**
    * Very efficient.
    * Need extra space.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Adjacency List:**  Create an adjacency list to represent the graph (flights).
2.  **Queue:**  Use a queue to store tuples of `(city, cost, stops)`. Initialize the queue with `(src, 0, 0)`.
3.  **Iteration:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a tuple `(city, cost, stops)`.
    *   If `city` is the destination (`dst`), update the `min_cost` if the current `cost` is smaller.
    * if `stops` greater than `k`, continue.
    *   For each neighbor and price in the adjacency list of the current `city`:
        *   Enqueue the neighbor with updated cost and stops: `(neighbor, cost + price, stops + 1)`.
4. Return the `min_cost`

**Data Structures:**

*   Adjacency List: Represents the graph.
*   Queue:  Used for the BFS traversal.

**Time Complexity:**

* In worst case it will be O(V+E) Where V and E are the number of vertices and edges.
*   O(N + K*E) where K the number of stops

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(N + E) in the worst case (for the adjacency list and queue)

**Trade-offs:**

*   BFS is suitable because we have a constraint on the number of stops (edges), effectively limiting the depth of the search.
*   Can be optimized by keeping track of min_cost found and stopping paths that will be more expensive than it

**Graph.md:**

```markdown
# Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects.

**Types of Graphs:**

*   **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction.  If there's an edge between A and B, you can go from A to B and from B to A.
*   **Directed Graph (Digraph):** Edges have a direction.  An edge from A to B doesn't necessarily mean there's an edge from B to A.
*   **Weighted Graph:**  Edges have weights (costs) associated with them.
*   **Unweighted Graph:** Edges have no weights.
*   **Cyclic Graph:**  Contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex).
*   **Acyclic Graph:** Contains no cycles.
* **Connected Graph:** There is path between any two nodes.
* **Disconnected Graph:** There is at least two nodes that there is no path between them.

**Representations:**

*   **Adjacency Matrix:**  A 2D array where `matrix[i][j]` represents the presence (or weight) of an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.
*   **Adjacency List:**  An array of lists, where each list stores the neighbors (and optionally, weights) of a vertex.

**Shortest Path.md:**

```markdown
# Shortest Path

The shortest path problem is a fundamental problem in graph theory.  Given a graph (weighted or unweighted) and two vertices (source and destination), the goal is to find the path between these vertices with the minimum total weight (or minimum number of edges in an unweighted graph).

**Algorithms for Shortest Path:**

*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**  Works for graphs with non-negative edge weights.
*   **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Works for graphs with negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).
*   **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**  Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  Finds the shortest path in an *unweighted* graph (in terms of the number of edges).
*  **A* search algorithm**

**Bellman-Ford Algorithm.md:**

```markdown
# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted digraph.  It can handle graphs with *negative* edge weights, unlike Dijkstra's algorithm. It can detect negative weight cycle.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a distance array `dist` of size *V* (number of vertices), initialized to infinity for all vertices except the source vertex, which is set to 0.
2.  **Relaxation:**
    *   Repeat the following *V-1* times:
        *   For each edge (u, v) with weight w in the graph:
            *   If `dist[u] + w < dist[v]`:
                *   `dist[v] = dist[u] + w`
3.  **Negative Cycle Detection:**
    *   After *V-1* iterations, iterate through all edges one more time. If any further relaxation is possible (`dist[u] + w < dist[v]`), then the graph contains a negative-weight cycle.

**Key Idea:**

The algorithm iteratively relaxes edges, gradually improving the estimated shortest distance to each vertex until it reaches the optimal solution.  The *V-1* iterations guarantee that the shortest paths are found, even with negative edge weights (as long as there are no negative cycles).

**Dijkstras Algorithm.md:**

```markdown
# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with *non-negative* edge weights.  It finds the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a distance array `dist` of size *V* (number of vertices), initialized to infinity for all vertices except the source vertex, which is set to 0.
    *   Create a set `visited` to keep track of visited vertices (initially empty).
    *   Create a priority queue `pq` to store vertices and their tentative distances, ordered by distance.
2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the priority queue is not empty:
        *   Extract the vertex *u* with the smallest distance from `pq`.
        *   Mark *u* as visited.
        *   For each neighbor *v* of *u*:
            *   If `dist[u] + weight(u, v) < dist[v]`:
                *   `dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)`
                *   Add/Update *v* in the priority queue with its new distance.

**Key Idea:**

Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy approach. It always selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source, ensuring that the shortest path to that vertex has been found.

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Optimal Substructure:**  An optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:** The same subproblems are encountered multiple times during the recursive solution of the problem.

**Approaches:**

*   **Top-Down (Memoization):**  Start with the original problem and recursively break it down into subproblems. Store the solutions to subproblems in a table (memo) to avoid recomputation.
*   **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):**  Start with the smallest subproblems and build up solutions to larger subproblems iteratively, storing the results in a table.

**Advantages:**

*   **Efficiency:**  DP can significantly reduce the time complexity of algorithms by avoiding redundant computations.
*   **Optimality:** DP guarantees finding the optimal solution for problems with optimal substructure.
