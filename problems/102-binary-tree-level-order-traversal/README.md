# Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. They are widely used in computer science to represent relationships between data elements.  Unlike linear data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues), trees organize data in a non-linear fashion.

## Basic Tree Terminology

*   **Node:**  A fundamental unit of a tree, containing data and links to other nodes.
*   **Root:** The topmost node in a tree.  There is only one root node.
*   **Parent:** A node that has a direct connection to another node (its child).
*   **Child:** A node that is directly connected to another node (its parent).
*   **Leaf:** A node with no children.
*   **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
*   **Depth (of a node):** The length of the path (number of edges) from the root to that node.
*   **Height (of a tree):** The maximum depth of any node in the tree (length of the longest path from the root to a leaf).
*   **Subtree:** A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.
* **Sibling:** Nodes with the same parent.

## Types of Trees

There are many different types of trees, each with specific properties and use cases. Some common ones include:

*   **Binary Tree:**  Each node has at most two children (referred to as the left child and the right child).
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):**  A binary tree with the property that for each node:
    *   All values in the left subtree are less than the node's value.
    *   All values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.
*   **AVL Tree:**  A self-balancing BST where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, preventing worst-case scenarios for operations.
*   **Red-Black Tree:** Another type of self-balancing BST, using "color" properties (red or black) for nodes to maintain balance.
*   **Trie (Prefix Tree):**  A tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
*   **Heap:**  A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (either min-heap or max-heap).

## Binary Tree Traversals

Traversals are methods for visiting all nodes in a tree in a specific order.  Common traversal methods for binary trees include:

*   **Inorder Traversal:**  Visit left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree.  For a BST, this visits the nodes in sorted order.
*   **Preorder Traversal:** Visit the current node, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
*   **Postorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the current node.
*   **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search):** Visit nodes level by level, from left to right.

## Advantages of Trees

*   **Hierarchical Representation:**  Naturally represent hierarchical relationships.
*   **Efficient Searching (for balanced trees):**  BSTs, AVL trees, and Red-Black trees provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations (O(log n) on average).
*   **Flexibility:**  Can be used to implement various other data structures and algorithms.

## Disadvantages of Trees

*   **Unbalanced Trees:**  If a tree becomes unbalanced, operations can degrade to O(n) complexity (similar to a linked list).
*   **Implementation Complexity:**  Some tree types (like self-balancing trees) can be more complex to implement than simpler data structures.

## Use Cases

*   **File Systems:** Representing directories and files.
*   **Databases:**  Indexing and organizing data.
*   **Compilers:**  Syntax trees.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Representing mathematical expressions.
*   **Network Routing:**  Finding optimal paths in a network.
*   **Decision Trees (Machine Learning):** Representing decision-making processes.
* **Game AI:**

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level.  It starts at a designated source node and visits all its immediate neighbors (nodes directly connected to it). Then, for each of those neighbors, it visits their unvisited neighbors, and so on.  This process continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.

## How BFS Works

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out) to store nodes to be visited.
    *   Mark the source node as visited and enqueue it.
    *   Create a data structure (e.g., a set or an array) to keep track of visited nodes.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
        *   Process the dequeued node (e.g., print its value, perform some operation).
        *   For each of the node's unvisited neighbors:
            *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
            *   Enqueue the neighbor.

## Key Concepts

*   **Queue:** BFS uses a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.  Nodes are visited in the order they are enqueued.
*   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph in layers.  It visits all nodes at depth 1 before visiting any nodes at depth 2, and so on.
*   **Visited Set:**  A data structure (often a set or an array) is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant visits.

## Example

Consider a graph represented by an adjacency list:

```
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

Starting from node 'A', BFS would visit the nodes in the following order: A, B, C, D, E, F.

## Time Complexity

*   **O(V + E)**, where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  Each node and each edge is visited at most once.

## Space Complexity

*   **O(V)** in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices. This happens when the graph is a complete graph or a very dense graph, and the queue might need to store all vertices at some point.  In practice, the space complexity can be less, depending on the graph's structure.

## Advantages of BFS

*   **Finds Shortest Path (in unweighted graphs):** BFS guarantees finding the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the source node to any other reachable node in an unweighted graph.
*   **Completeness:**  BFS is complete, meaning it will find a path to a target node if one exists.
*   **Simple to Implement:** The algorithm is relatively straightforward to implement using a queue.

## Disadvantages of BFS

*   **Memory Usage:** Can use a significant amount of memory, especially for large graphs.

## Use Cases

*   **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
*   **Web Crawling:**  Crawling web pages, starting from a seed URL and visiting links.
*   **Social Networks:**  Finding connections between people.
*   **Network Broadcasting:**  Sending a message to all nodes in a network.
*   **Garbage Collection:**  Identifying reachable objects in memory.
* **Level order traversal in trees**

# 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the *level order traversal of its nodes' values*. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Approach(es)

### BFS Approach (Iterative)

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   If the `root` is `None`, return an empty list.
    *   Create an empty list `result` to store the level order traversal.
    *   Create a queue `queue` and initialize it with the `root` node.
2.  **Iteration:** While the `queue` is not empty:
    *   Get the number of nodes at the current level (`level_size = len(queue)`).
    *   Create an empty list `current_level` to store the values of nodes at the current level.
    *   Iterate `level_size` times:
        *   Dequeue a node from the `queue`.
        *   Append the node's value to `current_level`.
        *   If the node has a left child, enqueue the left child.
        *   If the node has a right child, enqueue the right child.
    *   Append `current_level` to `result`.
3.  **Return:** Return the `result` list.

Data Structures:

*   Queue (from the `collections` module in Python - `deque`): Used to implement the BFS traversal.
*   List: Used to store the result (list of lists).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes at any level). In the worst case (a complete binary tree), w can be O(n), but for skewed trees, it can be much smaller.

Trade-offs:

*   BFS is generally the preferred approach for level order traversal because it directly implements the level-by-level exploration.

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**: Create an empty array called result
2. **Helper Function (recursive):**
    * if the node is `None` return.
    * if the `result` array length is less than or equal to the current level, this mean we should add new array to it
    * Append current node value to the sub array in the `result` at the `level` index.
    * Call the function recursively on the left child and right child (increasing `level` by one).

Data Structures:

*   List: Used to store the result (list of lists).

Time Complexity:

* O(N)

Space Complexity:

* O(H), H is the height of the tree.

Trade-offs:
* Not efficient as BFS approach for level order traverse.

## Code

[BFS Approach](./solution_bfs.py)

[Recursive Approach](./solution_recursive.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   BFS is the standard and most efficient way to perform a level order traversal of a binary tree.  The queue ensures that nodes are visited in the correct order.
*   The `deque` class from the `collections` module in Python is a double-ended queue, which is efficient for both enqueue and dequeue operations.
