# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation involves working directly with the individual bits of binary numbers. It's a powerful technique used in various computer science applications, including low-level programming, algorithm optimization, and cryptography. Understanding bitwise operators and how to apply them is crucial for efficient problem-solving.

## Basic Bitwise Operators

In most programming languages, the following bitwise operators are available:

*   **AND (`&`):**  Compares corresponding bits of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 & 0 = 0
    0 & 1 = 0
    1 & 0 = 0
    1 & 1 = 1
    ```

*   **OR (`|`):**  If at least one of the corresponding bits is 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 | 0 = 0
    0 | 1 = 1
    1 | 0 = 1
    1 | 1 = 1
    ```

*   **XOR (`^`):**  If the corresponding bits are different, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 ^ 0 = 0
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    1 ^ 1 = 0
    ```

*   **NOT (`~`):**  Flips the bits of a number (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).  Note: In many languages (like Python), `~x` is equivalent to `-x - 1` due to two's complement representation.
    ```
    ~0 = 1
    ~1 = 0
    ```

*   **Left Shift (`<<`):**  Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.  Zeros are filled in on the right.  This is equivalent to multiplying by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
    ```
    x << n  (multiply x by 2^n)
    ```

*   **Right Shift (`>>`):**  Shifts the bits to the right.  For unsigned integers (or non-negative integers), zeros are filled in on the left (logical right shift).  For signed integers, the behavior can be either logical (fill with 0) or arithmetic (fill with the sign bit - preserving the sign), depending on the language and compiler.  This is equivalent to integer division by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
    ```
     x >> n (divide x by 2^n)
    ```

## Common Bit Manipulation Techniques

*   **Checking if a bit is set:** `(x & (1 << n)) != 0`  (Checks if the nth bit of x is 1).
*   **Setting a bit:** `x |= (1 << n)`  (Sets the nth bit of x to 1).
*   **Clearing a bit:** `x &= ~(1 << n)` (Sets the nth bit of x to 0).
*   **Toggling a bit:** `x ^= (1 << n)` (Flips the nth bit of x).
*   **Getting the rightmost set bit:** `x & -x`  (Isolates the rightmost 1 bit. This relies on two's complement representation).
*   **Clearing the rightmost set bit:** `x & (x - 1)`
*   **Counting set bits (Hamming Weight):** Various methods exist, including:
    *   Iterating through bits and checking each one.
    *   Using the `x & (x - 1)` trick repeatedly until x becomes 0.
    *   Using built-in functions (e.g., `bin(x).count('1')` in Python, `__builtin_popcount(x)` in C++).
* **Check if a number is power of two:** `x && !(x & (x-1))`
* **Swap two numbers without temp:**
```python
x ^= y
y ^= x
x ^= y
```

## Advantages of Bit Manipulation

*   **Efficiency:** Bitwise operations are often very fast, as they are directly supported by the processor.
*   **Space Optimization:**  Can represent sets or flags compactly using individual bits within an integer.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Can lead to more efficient algorithms in certain situations.

## Use Cases

*   **Low-Level Programming:**  Interacting with hardware, device drivers, embedded systems.
*   **Cryptography:**  Encryption and decryption algorithms often use bitwise operations.
*   **Graphics:**  Manipulating pixel data.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:**  Solving problems involving subsets, permutations, or specific bit patterns.
*   **Data Compression:**  Some compression techniques rely on bitwise operations.
* **Networking:** Some low level networking staff require bit manipulation

# 190. Reverse Bits, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 below, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The input must be a binary string of length `32`.

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Approach(es)

### Bit-by-Bit Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialize:** Create a `result` variable, initialized to 0. This will store the reversed bits.
2.  **Iterate:** Loop 32 times (for each bit in a 32-bit integer):
    *   Left-shift `result` by 1: `result <<= 1`. This makes space for the next bit.
    *   Get the last bit of `n`: `n & 1`.
    *   Add the last bit of `n` to `result`: `result |= (n & 1)`.
    *   Right-shift `n` by 1: `n >>= 1`. This removes the last bit, so we can process the next one.
3.  **Return:** Return the `result`.

Data Structures:

*   Integer variables.

Time Complexity:

*   O(1) -  The loop always runs 32 times, which is a constant.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

### Optimized Approach (Byte-wise Reversal with Lookup)

Algorithm:

1.  **Lookup Table (Precomputation):** Create a lookup table (dictionary) `reversed_bytes` that stores the reversed byte values for all possible byte values (0-255). This is done *once* outside the main function.
2.  **Byte Extraction and Reversal:** Inside the `reverseBits` function:
    *   Initialize `result` to 0.
    *   Iterate 4 times (for each of the 4 bytes in a 32-bit integer):
        *   Extract a byte from `n`: `byte = (n >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF`.
        *   Look up the reversed byte in `reversed_bytes`.
        *   Left-shift `result` by 8 bits and add the reversed byte: `result = (result << 8) | reversed_bytes[byte]`.
3.  **Return:** Return the `result`.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (Hash Map) for the lookup table.

Time Complexity:

*   O(1) - The loop runs 4 times, and dictionary lookups are O(1) on average.  The precomputation of the lookup table is also O(1) (it's done only once).

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - The lookup table has a constant size (256 entries).

Trade-offs:

*   The optimized approach uses a lookup table to speed up the reversal process.  This is a classic space-time trade-off.  We use a small amount of extra memory (the lookup table) to significantly reduce the number of bitwise operations performed for each call to `reverseBits`.

## Notes (Optional)

*   **Follow-up Optimization:** The optimized approach with the lookup table addresses the follow-up question. If the function is called many times, the precomputed lookup table makes the bit reversal much faster.
*   **Alternative Optimized Approach:** The commented alternative uses similar operations like the first one.
