Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for problem 437, "Path Sum III".

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 437
*   **Problem Name:** Path Sum III
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We will create a directory named `0437-path-sum-iii`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since no solution was provided, I'll generate two Python solutions:

1.  **Brute Force (Recursive):** A straightforward recursive approach that checks all possible paths.
2.  **Prefix Sum (Optimized, Recursive):** Uses a hash map (dictionary) to store prefix sums and efficiently count paths. This is the more efficient solution.

First, define the TreeNode:

```python
# 0437-path-sum-iii/tree_node.py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def list_to_tree(lst):
  """Convert a list to tree Level-Order Traversal."""
  if not lst:
      return None

  root = TreeNode(lst[0])
  queue = [root]
  i = 1

  while i < len(lst):
      node = queue.pop(0)

      if lst[i] is not None:
          node.left = TreeNode(lst[i])
          queue.append(node.left)
      i += 1

      if i < len(lst) and lst[i] is not None:
          node.right = TreeNode(lst[i])
          queue.append(node.right)
      i += 1
  return root

def tree_to_list(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    queue = [root]

    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)

        if node:
            result.append(node.val)
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
        else:
            result.append(None)

    # Remove trailing None values that don't affect structure
    while result and result[-1] is None:
        result.pop()

    return result
```

Now Brute Force approach:

```python
# 0437-path-sum-iii/solution_brute_force.py
# 437. Path Sum III - Brute Force (Recursive)

from .tree_node import TreeNode

def pathSum(root: TreeNode, targetSum: int) -> int:
    def pathSumFrom(node: TreeNode, targetSum: int) -> int:
        """Counts paths starting from the given node."""
        if not node:
            return 0

        count = 0
        if node.val == targetSum:
            count += 1

        count += pathSumFrom(node.left, targetSum - node.val)
        count += pathSumFrom(node.right, targetSum - node.val)
        return count

    if not root:
        return 0

    return (pathSumFrom(root, targetSum) +
            pathSum(root.left, targetSum) +
            pathSum(root.right, targetSum))
```

Optimized solution:

```python
# 0437-path-sum-iii/solution_prefix_sum.py
# 437. Path Sum III - Prefix Sum (Optimized, Recursive)

from .tree_node import TreeNode

def pathSum(root: TreeNode, targetSum: int) -> int:
    def pathSumHelper(node: TreeNode, curr_sum: int, prefix_sums: dict, targetSum:int) -> int:
        if not node:
            return 0

        curr_sum += node.val
        count = prefix_sums.get(curr_sum - targetSum, 0) # Check for paths ending at current node

        prefix_sums[curr_sum] = prefix_sums.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1

        count += pathSumHelper(node.left, curr_sum, prefix_sums, targetSum)
        count += pathSumHelper(node.right, curr_sum, prefix_sums, targetSum)

        prefix_sums[curr_sum] -= 1  # Backtrack: Remove current sum for other paths
        return count
    prefix_sums = {0:1} # Initialize with 0:1 to handle paths starting from root
    return pathSumHelper(root, 0, prefix_sums,targetSum)
```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

```markdown
# 437. Path Sum III, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: 3

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
*   -10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>
*   -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

## Approach(es)

### Brute Force (Recursive)

Algorithm:

1.  **`pathSumFrom(node, targetSum)`:**  A recursive helper function that counts the number of paths that sum to `targetSum` *starting from the given `node`*.
    *   Base Case: If `node` is null, return 0.
    *   Check if the current node's value equals `targetSum`. If so, increment the count.
    *   Recursively call `pathSumFrom` on the left and right children, reducing `targetSum` by the current node's value.
    *   Return the total count.
2.  **`pathSum(root, targetSum)`:** The main function.
    *   Base Case: If `root` is null, return 0.
    *   Call `pathSumFrom` starting from the root.
    *   Recursively call `pathSum` on the left and right subtrees to consider paths that *don't* start at the root.
    *   Return the sum of the counts from all three calls.

Data Structures:

*   None explicitly used, relies on the call stack for recursion.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree).  For each node, we might traverse the entire subtree below it.
*   O(N log N) on average for a balanced tree.

Space Complexity:

*   O(N) in the worst case (skewed tree) due to recursion depth.
*   O(log N) on average for a balanced tree.

Trade-offs:

-   Simple and easy to understand.
-   Inefficient for larger trees due to repeated calculations.

### Prefix Sum (Optimized, Recursive)

Algorithm:

1.  **`pathSumHelper(node, curr_sum, prefix_sums)`:**  A recursive helper function.
    *   Base Case: If `node` is null, return 0.
    *   Update `curr_sum` by adding the current node's value.
    *   Check how many times `curr_sum - targetSum` has appeared as a prefix sum.  This represents the number of paths ending at the current node that sum to `targetSum`.
    *   Increment the count of `curr_sum` in the `prefix_sums` dictionary.
    *   Recursively call `pathSumHelper` on the left and right children.
    *   **Backtrack:** Decrement the count of `curr_sum` in `prefix_sums` before returning. This is crucial to remove the current prefix sum from consideration for paths in other subtrees.
2.  **`pathSum(root, targetSum)`:** The main function.
    *   Initialize `prefix_sums` with `{0: 1}`.  This handles cases where a path starting from the root sums to `targetSum`.
    * Call pathSumHelper.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (Hash Map): `prefix_sums` stores the cumulative sums encountered so far and their frequencies.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(N) in the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree where all nodes have the same value), as the `prefix_sums` dictionary might store up to N entries.  On average, for a balanced tree, it would be O(log N).

Trade-offs:

-   Significantly more efficient than the brute-force approach.
-   Uses extra space for the `prefix_sums` dictionary.
-   Requires careful backtracking to ensure correctness.

[Brute Force (Recursive)](./solution_brute_force.py)
[Prefix Sum (Optimized, Recursive)](./solution_prefix_sum.py)
[TreeNode Class](./tree_node.py)
## Notes (Optional)

*   The prefix sum approach is a classic optimization technique for problems involving finding subarrays or subpaths with a given sum.
*   The initialization of `prefix_sums` with `{0: 1}` is essential.
*   The backtracking step in the optimized solution is very important; without it, the counts will be incorrect.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The relevant topics are:

1.  **Tree Traversal:** Both solutions involve traversing a binary tree.
2.  **Recursion:** Both solutions are recursive.
3.  **Prefix Sum:** Used in the optimized solution.
4.  **Hash Table:**  The `prefix_sums` dictionary in the optimized solution.
5. **Depth First Search**

We have already generated files for *Recursion*, *Prefix Sum*, and *Hash Table*. Now generate `Tree_Traversal.md`, and `Depth_First_Search.md`.

# Tree Traversal

## Explanation

Tree traversal (also known as tree search) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.  There are several ways to traverse a tree, broadly categorized as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

Common Traversal Methods:

*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
    *   **Preorder:** Visit the root, then recursively traverse the left subtree, then recursively traverse the right subtree.
    *   **Inorder:** Recursively traverse the left subtree, then visit the root, then recursively traverse the right subtree. (Applicable primarily to binary search trees).
    *   **Postorder:** Recursively traverse the left subtree, then recursively traverse the right subtree, then visit the root.
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
    *   Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.  Uses a queue.

## Example (Python - using TreeNode):

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def preorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        print(root.val)  # Visit root
        preorder_traversal(root.left)
        preorder_traversal(root.right)

def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)
        print(root.val)  # Visit root
        inorder_traversal(root.right)

def postorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        postorder_traversal(root.left)
        postorder_traversal(root.right)
        print(root.val)  # Visit root

def breadth_first_traversal(root):
    if not root: return
    queue = [root] # Use list as a queue
    while(queue):
        node = queue.pop(0)
        print(node.val)
        if node.left: queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right: queue.append(node.right)

# Example tree:
#     1
#    / \
#   2   3
#  / \
# 4   5

root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3))
print("Preorder")
preorder_traversal(root) #1,2,4,5,3
print("Inorder")
inorder_traversal(root) #4,2,5,1,3
print("Postorder")
postorder_traversal(root) #4,5,2,3,1
print("BFS")
breadth_first_traversal(root) # 1,2,3,4,5
```

# Depth First Search

## Explanation
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Key Concepts:

-   **Recursive (or Stack-Based):**  DFS is typically implemented recursively, which implicitly uses the call stack.  It can also be implemented iteratively using an explicit stack.
-   **Exploration Order:**  Explores deeply into one branch before exploring other branches.
-   **Backtracking:**  When a dead end is reached (no more unvisited neighbors), the algorithm backtracks to the previous node and explores another branch.

Algorithm (Recursive):

1.  **Visit** the current node.
2.  **Mark** the current node as visited.
3.  For each **unvisited** neighbor of the current node:
    -   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.

Algorithm (Iterative using Stack):
1. Push root node to stack.
2. While stack is not empty:
  - Pop node from stack.
  - If node is not visited:
     - Mark as visited.
     - Push all unvisited neighbor to stack.

Common Uses:

-   **Tree Traversals:** Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals are all forms of DFS.
-   **Graph Traversals:**  Finding connected components, cycle detection, topological sorting.
-   **Pathfinding:** Finding a path between two nodes.
-   **Solving Puzzles:** Many puzzles (e.g., mazes, Sudoku) can be solved using DFS.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**

## Example (Python - Graph represented as adjacency list)
```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, start_node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()

    visited.add(start_node)
    print(start_node)  # Process the node (e.g., print it)

    for neighbor in graph[start_node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)
def dfs_iterative(graph,start_node):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start_node]
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            print(vertex) # Process
            # Add unvisited neighbors to the stack
            # Add in reverse to visit in the same order as recursion
            for neighbor in reversed(graph[vertex]):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)


# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

print("Recursive DFS")
dfs_recursive(graph, 'A') # A, B, D, E, F, C
print("Iterative DFS")
dfs_iterative(graph,'A')
```
