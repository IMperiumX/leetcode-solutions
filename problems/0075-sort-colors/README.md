Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for "Sort Colors" (Problem 75).

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `75. Sort Colors ... [problem description]`."

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

We'll generate two solutions: one using a two-pass counting sort approach and another using the one-pass Dutch National Flag algorithm.

*   **Prompt 3.2:** "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Sort Colors` (Number: `75`). ... Create files named `solution_counting.py` and `solution_dutch.py`."

def sortColors_counting(nums):
    """
    Sorts an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in-place using counting sort (two-pass).

    Args:

    """
    counts = [0] * 3  # Count occurrences of 0, 1, and 2.

    # Count the occurrences of each color.
    for num in nums:

    # Reconstruct the array based on the counts.
    i = 0

    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 0:

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file for the problem: `Sort Colors` (Number: `75`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

```markdown
# 75. Sort Colors, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

## Approach(es)

### Counting Sort (Two-Pass)

Algorithm:

1.  **Count Occurrences:** Create an array `counts` of size 3 (for colors 0, 1, and 2). Iterate through the input array `nums` and increment `counts[num]` for each element `num`. This counts how many times each color appears.
2.  **Reconstruct Array:** Iterate through the `counts` array. For each color `c` (0, 1, and 2), write `counts[c]` copies of `c` back into the `nums` array, starting from the beginning.

Data Structures:

*   An auxiliary array `counts` of size 3 to store the counts of each color.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) for counting + O(n) for reconstruction = O(n) overall.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - The `counts` array has a constant size of 3, which is independent of the input size `n`.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is simple and uses counting sort which can be efficient.  It uses two passes, which is not optimal.

### Dutch National Flag Algorithm (One-Pass)

Algorithm:

This algorithm is named after the Dutch flag, which has three horizontal bands of red, white, and blue.  We use three pointers:

1.  `low`:  Points to the end of the region containing only 0s.
2.  `mid`:  Points to the current element being examined.
3.  `high`: Points to the beginning of the region containing only 2s.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

*   Initialize `low = 0`, `mid = 0`, and `high = len(nums) - 1`.
*   While `mid <= high`:
    *   If `nums[mid] == 0`: Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[low]`, increment `low` and `mid`.
    *   If `nums[mid] == 1`: Increment `mid`.
    *   If `nums[mid] == 2`: Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[high]`, decrement `high`.  *Do not* increment `mid` in this case, as the swapped element from `high` needs to be checked.
*   The array is now sorted.

Data Structures:

*   No extra data structures are used beyond a few integer pointers.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - Each element is examined and potentially swapped at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is more efficient than the two-pass counting sort as it sorts in a single pass. It's a bit more complex to understand and implement correctly.

## Notes

The Dutch National Flag Algorithm is the optimal solution, satisfying the follow-up requirement of one-pass and constant extra space. It is a classic example of an in-place sorting algorithm for a limited range of values. It is also related to the partition step of quicksort.

# Two Pointers

The Two Pointers technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, or linked lists. It involves using two pointers (usually indices or references) that traverse the data structure in a coordinated way. This technique is particularly useful for problems that require finding pairs, subarrays, or subsequences that satisfy certain conditions, or for performing in-place modifications.

## Key Concepts

*   **Pointers:** Variables that store indices (for arrays/strings) or references (for linked lists).
*   **Traversal:** The pointers move through the data structure, often from opposite ends or in the same direction, depending on the problem.
*   **In-Place Operations:** Many two-pointer algorithms modify the data structure directly without using extra space (O(1) space complexity).
*   **Efficiency:** The two-pointer approach can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) or O(n log n) to O(n) in many cases.

## Common Patterns

1.  **Opposite Ends (Converging):**
    *   Two pointers start at the beginning and end of the array/string and move towards each other.
    *   Commonly used for:
        *   Finding pairs that sum to a target value (e.g., Two Sum II - Input array is sorted).
        *   Reversing an array/string in-place.
        *   Palindrome checking.

2.  **Same Direction (Sliding Window):**
    *   Two pointers start at the beginning and move in the same direction.
    *   Often used to find subarrays or substrings that meet certain criteria.
    *   Commonly used for:
        *   Finding the longest/shortest subarray with a given property.
        *   Finding the maximum/minimum sum subarray.
        *   String matching problems.

3.  **Fast and Slow Pointers (Floyd's Cycle Detection):**
    *   One pointer (fast) moves faster than the other (slow).
    *   Primarily used in linked lists.
    *   Commonly used for:
        *   Detecting cycles in a linked list.
        *   Finding the middle of a linked list.
        *   Finding the intersection point of two linked lists.

4.  **Multiple Iterations:**
    *   Sometimes two pointers may traverse parts or all of the array at different times.
    *   Used for problems requiring multiple dependent passes over the data.

## Examples

*   **Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted:** Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target value. Use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end.  Move the pointers based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target.
*   **Reverse String:** Reverse a string in-place. Use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end. Swap characters and move the pointers towards the middle.
*   **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:** Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  Use two pointers (start and end of a window) and a set/map to track characters within the window.
*   **Linked List Cycle:** Detect if a linked list has a cycle. Use a slow pointer (moves one step at a time) and a fast pointer (moves two steps at a time). If they meet, there's a cycle.
* **Sort Colors:** Utilize multiple pointers for each number.

## Use Cases

*   Array/String manipulation.
*   Searching for pairs or subarrays.
*   In-place modifications.
*   Linked list problems (cycle detection, finding the middle, etc.).

## Advantages

*   **Efficiency:** Can significantly improve time complexity.
*   **In-Place Operations:** Many problems can be solved with O(1) space complexity.
*   **Versatile:** Applicable to a wide range of problems.

## Disadvantages

*   **Complexity:**  Can be tricky to implement correctly, especially with multiple conditions and edge cases.
*   **Not Always Applicable:**  Not all problems can be solved efficiently with two pointers.
