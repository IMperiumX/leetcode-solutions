# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation involves working directly with the individual bits of binary numbers. It's a powerful technique used in various computer science applications, including low-level programming, algorithm optimization, and cryptography. Understanding bitwise operators and how to apply them is crucial for efficient problem-solving.

## Basic Bitwise Operators

In most programming languages, the following bitwise operators are available:

*   **AND (`&`):**  Compares corresponding bits of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 & 0 = 0
    0 & 1 = 0
    1 & 0 = 0
    1 & 1 = 1
    ```

*   **OR (`|`):**  If at least one of the corresponding bits is 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 | 0 = 0
    0 | 1 = 1
    1 | 0 = 1
    1 | 1 = 1
    ```

*   **XOR (`^`):**  If the corresponding bits are different, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
    ```
    0 ^ 0 = 0
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    1 ^ 1 = 0
    ```

*   **NOT (`~`):**  Flips the bits of a number (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).  Note: In many languages (like Python), `~x` is equivalent to `-x - 1` due to two's complement representation.
    ```
    ~0 = 1
    ~1 = 0
    ```

*   **Left Shift (`<<`):**  Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.  Zeros are filled in on the right.  This is equivalent to multiplying by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
    ```
    x << n  (multiply x by 2^n)
    ```

*   **Right Shift (`>>`):**  Shifts the bits to the right.  For unsigned integers (or non-negative integers), zeros are filled in on the left (logical right shift).  For signed integers, the behavior can be either logical (fill with 0) or arithmetic (fill with the sign bit - preserving the sign), depending on the language and compiler.  This is equivalent to integer division by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
    ```
     x >> n (divide x by 2^n)
    ```

## Common Bit Manipulation Techniques

*   **Checking if a bit is set:** `(x & (1 << n)) != 0`  (Checks if the nth bit of x is 1).
*   **Setting a bit:** `x |= (1 << n)`  (Sets the nth bit of x to 1).
*   **Clearing a bit:** `x &= ~(1 << n)` (Sets the nth bit of x to 0).
*   **Toggling a bit:** `x ^= (1 << n)` (Flips the nth bit of x).
*   **Getting the rightmost set bit:** `x & -x`  (Isolates the rightmost 1 bit. This relies on two's complement representation).
*   **Clearing the rightmost set bit:** `x & (x - 1)`
*   **Counting set bits (Hamming Weight):** Various methods exist, including:
    *   Iterating through bits and checking each one.
    *   Using the `x & (x - 1)` trick repeatedly until x becomes 0.
    *   Using built-in functions (e.g., `bin(x).count('1')` in Python, `__builtin_popcount(x)` in C++).
* **Check if a number is power of two:** `x && !(x & (x-1))`
* **Swap two numbers without temp:**
```python
x ^= y
y ^= x
x ^= y
```

## Advantages of Bit Manipulation

* **Efficiency:** Bitwise operations are often very fast, as they are directly supported by the processor.
* **Space Optimization:**  Can represent sets or flags compactly using individual bits within an integer.
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Can lead to more efficient algorithms in certain situations.

## Use Cases

* **Low-Level Programming:**  Interacting with hardware, device drivers, embedded systems.
* **Cryptography:**  Encryption and decryption algorithms often use bitwise operations.
* **Graphics:**  Manipulating pixel data.
* **Algorithm Optimization:**  Solving problems involving subsets, permutations, or specific bit patterns.
* **Data Compression:**  Some compression techniques rely on bitwise operations.
* **Networking:** Some low level networking staff require bit manipulation

# Custom-001. Count Set Bits, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Example 1:**

```

Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation:
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: n = 128
Output: 1
Explanation:
The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

```

**Example 3:**

```

Input: n = 2147483645
Output: 30
Explanation:
The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Approach(es)

### Iterative Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialize:** Set a `count` variable to 0.
2.  **Iterate:** While `n` is greater than 0:
    *   Check the least significant bit: `n & 1` will be 1 if the last bit is set, and 0 otherwise.  Add this result to `count`.
    *   Right-shift `n` by 1: `n >>= 1` (equivalent to `n = n // 2`). This effectively removes the last bit.
3.  **Return:** Return the final `count`.

Data Structures:

*   None explicitly used.

Time Complexity:

*   O(log n) -  The number of iterations is equal to the number of bits in `n`, which is logarithmic with respect to `n`.  In the worst case (all bits set), it's O(32) for 32-bit integers, which is still considered constant time in practice.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

### Built-in Function Approach (Python-Specific)

Algorithm:

1.  **Convert to Binary:** Use the built-in `bin(n)` function to convert the integer `n` to its binary string representation.
2.  **Count '1's:** Use the string's `count('1')` method to count the number of '1' characters in the binary string.
3.  **Return:** Return the count.

Data Structures:

*   String (temporarily, for the binary representation).

Time Complexity:

*   O(log n) - The `bin(n)` conversion and `count('1')` operation both take time proportional to the number of bits in `n`.

Space Complexity:

*  O(log n): For storing binary representation of the integer.

Trade-offs:

*   This is a very concise and readable solution in Python.
*   It relies on built-in functions, which might have their own underlying implementations and performance characteristics.

### Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialize:** Set a `count` variable to 0.
2.  **Iterate:** While `n` is greater than 0:
    *   Clear the least significant set bit: `n &= (n - 1)`. This operation cleverly removes the rightmost '1' bit in `n`.
    *   Increment `count`.
3.  **Return:** Return the final `count`.

Data Structures:

*   None explicitly used.

Time Complexity:

*   O(k), where k is the number of set bits in `n`.  This is often faster than the iterative approach because it only iterates as many times as there are set bits, *not* as many times as there are total bits.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

Trade-offs:

*   This is generally the most efficient approach for counting set bits, especially when the number of set bits is significantly smaller than the total number of bits.
*   It might be slightly less intuitive than the iterative approach.

## Notes (Optional)

*   **Follow-up Optimization:** For repeated calls, consider the following:
    *   **Lookup Table (Precomputation):** If the range of possible input values is limited (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit integers), you could precompute the number of set bits for all possible values and store them in a lookup table (an array or hash map).  Then, each call would simply be an O(1) lookup. This is a space-time trade-off; you use more memory to achieve faster lookups.
    *   **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm** is generally the most efficient approach when a lookup table is not feasible.
    * If you know for sure your numbers are limited (e.g to 8 bits) then you can use lookup table.
