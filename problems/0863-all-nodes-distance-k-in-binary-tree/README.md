Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for "All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree".

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1**: "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Output**: "Problem Number: 863, Problem Name: All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0863-all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2**: "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree` (Number: `863`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`..."

    *   I'll implement a solution that combines Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).  DFS is used to build a parent map (to treat the tree as an undirected graph), and then BFS is used to find nodes at distance K.

    # 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree, Difficulty: Medium

    ## Problem Description

    Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node `target`, and an integer `k`, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance `k` from the target node.

    You can return the answer in any order.

    Example 1:

    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
    Output: [7,4,1]
    Explanation: The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.

    Example 2:

    Input: root = [1], target = 1, k = 3
    Output: []

    Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 500].
    0 <= Node.val <= 500
    All the values Node.val are unique.
    target is the value of one of the nodes in the tree.
    0 <= k <= 1000

    ## Approach(es)

    ### DFS + BFS Approach

    Algorithm:

    1.  **Build Parent Map (DFS):**
        *   Create a dictionary `parent_map` to store the parent of each node.  This effectively transforms the tree into an undirected graph, allowing us to traverse "upwards" from the target node.
        *   Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the `root`.
        *   In the `dfs` function:
            *   If the current `node` is not `None`:
                *   Store the `parent` of the current `node` in `parent_map`.
                *   Recursively call `dfs` on the left child (`node.left`) with the current `node` as the parent.
                *   Recursively call `dfs` on the right child (`node.right`) with the current `node` as the parent.

    2.  **Find Nodes at Distance K (BFS):**
        *   Initialize a queue `queue` (using `collections.deque`) for Breadth-First Search (BFS).  Start with the `target` node and a distance of 0: `queue = deque([(target, 0)])`.
        *   Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles. Add the `target` node to `visited`.
        *   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the values of nodes at distance `k`.
        *   While the `queue` is not empty:
            *   Dequeue a `(node, distance)` pair from the front of the `queue`.
            *   **Check Distance:**
                *   If `distance` equals `k`, append `node.val` to the `result` list.
                *   If `distance` is greater than `k`, we can skip (or continue).
                *   If `distance` is less than 'k', we need to explore the neighbors of node.

            * **Explore Neighbors:** get all neighbor nodes (left child, right child and parent using the parent map)
                * Iterate through the neighbors of the current node which are (left child, right child and parent)
                *   For each neighbor, If the `neighbor` is not `None` and has not been visited:
                        *   Add the `neighbor` to the `visited` set.
                        *   Enqueue the `neighbor` and its distance (`distance + 1`) into the `queue`.

    3.  **Return Result:** Return the `result` list.

    Data Structures:

    -   Dictionary (`parent_map`): To store the parent of each node.
    -   Queue (`collections.deque`): For BFS traversal.
    -   Set (`visited`): To track visited nodes.

    Time Complexity:

    -   O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  The DFS takes O(N) to build the parent map, and the BFS also takes O(N) in the worst case (where we might visit all nodes).

    Space Complexity:

    -   O(N). The `parent_map` stores N entries, the `queue` can hold up to N nodes in the worst case, and the `visited` set can also store up to N nodes.

    Trade-offs:
     - By using DFS and BFS we convert the tree to undirected graph to be able to traverse up to the parents, then use BFS to find nodes with K distance.

    ## Code

    [DFS + BFS Approach](./solution.py)

    ## Notes (Optional)

      -  The crucial part is converting the tree into an undirected graph by building the parent map.
      - We are using `parent_map.get(node)` instead of direct access like  `parent_map[node]` as it will prevent raising `KeyError` exception if the node doesn't have parent.
      - BFS guarantees we find nodes at the *shortest* distance, which is essential for this problem.

- Topic Extraction
```markdown
# Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a chosen node (often the root in a tree) and explores one of its neighbors, then explores one of *that* neighbor's neighbors, and so on, until it reaches a dead end (a node with no unvisited neighbors).  Then, it backtracks to the previous node and explores another branch.

Key Characteristics:

-   **Recursive (or Stack-Based):** DFS is typically implemented recursively.  The call stack implicitly manages the order of visiting nodes. It can also be implemented iteratively using an explicit stack.
-   **Explores Deeply:**  Prioritizes exploring one branch completely before moving to another.
-   **Backtracking:**  When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous node and explores a different branch.
-   **Not Guaranteed Shortest Path:** Unlike BFS, DFS does *not* guarantee finding the shortest path in a general graph.
-   **Completeness:** DFS is complete, meaning it will find a path to the target node if one exists (assuming the graph is finite).

Algorithm (Recursive Implementation):

1.  **Base Case:** If the current node is `None` (or meets some other stopping condition), return.
2.  **Mark as Visited:** Mark the current node as visited (e.g., add it to a `visited` set).
3.  **Process Node:**  Perform any desired operation on the current node (e.g., print its value, add it to a result list, etc.).
4.  **Recursive Calls:** For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call the DFS function on the neighbor.

Use Cases:

-   **Pathfinding (not necessarily shortest):** Finding *any* path between two nodes.
-   **Topological Sorting:** Ordering nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A comes before node B in the ordering.
-   **Cycle Detection:** Determining if a graph contains cycles.
-   **Connected Components:** Finding connected components in an undirected graph.
-   **Solving Puzzles:**  Many puzzles (e.g., mazes, Sudoku) can be solved using DFS.
-   **Tree Traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder):** Visiting all nodes of a tree in specific orders.
-  **Building Parent Map**
