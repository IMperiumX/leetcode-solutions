# 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).

**Example 3:**

Input: root = [1,3,2,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Approach(es)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - **Algorithm:**
    - Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal (BFS).
    - For each node, store its position in a complete binary tree.  The root is at position 0.  If a node is at position `p`, its left child is at `2*p` and its right child is at `2*p + 1`.
    - For each level, calculate the width as the difference between the positions of the rightmost and leftmost nodes, plus 1.
    - Keep track of the maximum width encountered.

 - **Data Structures:**
   - Queue (specifically, `collections.deque` in Python for efficiency).
  - **Time Complexity:**
      - O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  We visit each node once.

  - **Space Complexity:**
    - O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree.  In the worst case (a complete binary tree), w can be proportional to n (specifically, up to n/2 for the last level), so the space complexity can be O(n) in the worst case.  However, on average, for skewed or unbalanced trees, the width will be much less than n.
  - **Trade-offs:**
      - BFS is generally a good choice for finding level-related properties of a tree.  The position tracking is the key to solving this problem efficiently.

## Notes (Optional)

- A Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is also possible, but it's generally more complex to implement for this specific problem because you need to keep track of the leftmost position at each level. BFS naturally handles levels, making it a more suitable choice.
- Integer Overflow:  The problem statement guarantees the answer is within a 32-bit signed integer.  However, if the tree is extremely wide, the calculated positions (`2 * position` and `2 * position + 1`) could potentially cause an integer overflow in languages with fixed-size integers. In Python, integers have arbitrary precision, so this isn't a concern. In languages like C++ or Java, you might need to use a larger data type (e.g., `long long`) for the position calculations or use modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow. However, given the problem constraints (3000 nodes), this will not be an issue for the submitted solutions.

# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.  It's a fundamental data structure used in various algorithms and applications.

## Key Concepts

*   **Node:** The basic building block of a binary tree.  Each node contains:
    *   Data (a value)
    *   A pointer/reference to its left child (can be `None`/`null`)
    *   A pointer/reference to its right child (can be `None`/`null`)
*   **Root:** The topmost node in the tree.  There is only one root.
*   **Leaf Node (External Node):** A node with no children (both left and right children are `None`/`null`).
*   **Internal Node:** A node with at least one child.
*   **Parent Node:** A node that has one or more children.
*   **Child Node:** A node that is connected to a parent node.
*   **Sibling Nodes:** Nodes that share the same parent.
*   **Ancestor Node:**  A node that is reachable by following parent pointers from a given node.  The root is an ancestor of all other nodes.
*   **Descendant Node:** A node that is reachable by following child pointers from a given node.
*   **Level (Depth):** The distance (number of edges) from the root to a node. The root is at level 0.
*   **Height:**  The maximum distance (number of edges) from the root to any leaf node.  The height of an empty tree is often defined as -1.  The height of a tree with only a root node is 0.
*   **Subtree:** A tree formed by a node and all of its descendants.
*   **Complete Binary Tree:** Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
*   **Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree):** Every node has either 0 or 2 children.  No node has only one child.
*   **Perfect Binary Tree:** A full binary tree in which all leaf nodes are at the same level.
*  **Balanced Binary Tree:** The heights of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most 1 (or a small constant). This helps to ensure efficient search operations in self-balancing trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

## Tree Traversals

These are algorithms for visiting (processing) each node in a tree exactly once.

*   **Pre-order Traversal:**
    1.  Visit the root.
    2.  Traverse the left subtree (pre-order).
    3.  Traverse the right subtree (pre-order).
*   **In-order Traversal:** (Applicable primarily to binary search trees)
    1.  Traverse the left subtree (in-order).
    2.  Visit the root.
    3.  Traverse the right subtree (in-order).
*   **Post-order Traversal:**
    1.  Traverse the left subtree (post-order).
    2.  Traverse the right subtree (post-order).
    3.  Visit the root.
*   **Level-order Traversal (Breadth-First Search - BFS):**
    1.  Visit nodes level by level, from left to right. This typically uses a queue.

## Common Operations

*   **Insertion:** Adding a new node to the tree.
*   **Deletion:** Removing a node from the tree.
*   **Search:** Finding a node with a specific value.
*   **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a specific order (pre-order, in-order, post-order, level-order).
*   **Height/Depth Calculation:** Determining the height of the tree or the depth of a node.

## Advantages of Binary Trees

*   **Efficient Search (Binary Search Trees):** In a balanced binary search tree, searching, insertion, and deletion can be performed in O(log n) time on average, where n is the number of nodes.
*   **Hierarchical Representation:** Binary trees are well-suited for representing hierarchical data.
*   **Flexibility:** They can be used to implement various other data structures (e.g., heaps, sets, maps).

## Disadvantages of Binary Trees

*   **Unbalanced Trees:** If a binary search tree becomes unbalanced, its performance can degrade to O(n) for search, insertion, and deletion.
*   **Complexity:**  Some tree operations (especially deletion) can be more complex to implement than with simpler data structures like arrays or linked lists.

## Use Cases

*   **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):** Used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of sorted data.
*   **Heaps:** Used in priority queues and heapsort.
*   **Expression Trees:** Used in compilers to represent and evaluate mathematical expressions.
*   **Huffman Coding Trees:** Used in data compression.
*   **File Systems:**  Directories and files can be organized in a tree structure.
*   **Databases:**  B-trees (a generalization of binary trees) are used for indexing.
*   **Game AI:**  Decision trees and game state trees.
