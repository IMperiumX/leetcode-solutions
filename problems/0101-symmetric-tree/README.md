# Trees

Trees are a fundamental non-linear data structure in computer science. They consist of nodes connected by edges, forming a hierarchical structure. Unlike linear data structures like arrays or linked lists, trees can represent relationships between data elements in a more complex and intuitive way.

## Key Concepts

*   **Node:** The basic building block of a tree. Each node contains data and may have links (pointers) to other nodes.
*   **Root:** The topmost node in a tree.  It is the only node without a parent.
*   **Parent:** A node that has one or more child nodes.
*   **Child:** A node that is connected to a parent node.
*   **Leaf:** A node with no children.
*   **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
*   **Depth (of a node):** The number of edges from the root to the node.
*   **Height (of a node):** The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.  The height of a tree is the height of its root.
*   **Subtree:** A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.

## Types of Trees

*   **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children (left and right). This is a very common type of tree.
*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree with the property that for each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value. This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
*   **Balanced Tree:** A tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1 (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees).  Balanced trees help prevent worst-case scenarios for operations like searching in BSTs.
*   **N-ary Tree:** Each node can have up to N children.
*   **Trie (Prefix Tree):**  A specialized tree used for storing strings, where each node represents a character and paths from the root to a node represent prefixes.

## Common Tree Traversals

*   **Inorder Traversal (for Binary Trees):** Visit the left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree.  For BSTs, this visits nodes in sorted order.
*   **Preorder Traversal:** Visit the current node, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
*   **Postorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the current node.
*   **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search):** Visit nodes level by level, from top to bottom and left to right.

## Common Tree Operations

*   **Insertion:** Adding a new node to the tree.
*   **Deletion:** Removing a node from the tree.
*   **Search:** Finding a node with a specific value.
*   **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a specific order.
*    **Checking for properties:** Determining if the tree satisfies certain conditions, such as being balanced, being a valid BST, or being symmetric.

# Recursion

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. It's a fundamental concept in computer science, often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

## Key Concepts

*   **Base Case:** A condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
*   **Recursive Step:** The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified input, moving towards the base case.

## How Recursion Works

1.  **Function Call:** When a recursive function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack. This frame stores the function's local variables and parameters for that particular invocation.
2.  **Recursive Calls:** The function calls itself repeatedly, with each call creating a new stack frame.
3.  **Base Case Reached:** When the base case is met, the function returns a value without making further recursive calls.
4.  **Unwinding the Stack:** As each recursive call returns, its corresponding stack frame is removed from the call stack, and the execution flow returns to the previous call.  Values are returned up the stack until the initial call is reached.

## Advantages of Recursion

*   **Elegance and Readability:** Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to understand for problems with a naturally recursive structure (e.g., tree traversals, factorials).
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Recursion naturally breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

## Disadvantages of Recursion

*   **Stack Overflow:** Excessive recursion can lead to a stack overflow error if the call stack becomes too large.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Function calls have overhead, so recursive solutions can sometimes be slower than iterative solutions, especially for deep recursion.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging recursive functions can be more challenging than debugging iterative code.

## Common Recursive Patterns

*   **Divide and Conquer:** Breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining the results (e.g., merge sort, quicksort).
*   **Tree Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a tree using inorder, preorder, or postorder traversal.
*   **Backtracking:** Exploring all possible solutions by trying out different choices and undoing them if they don't lead to a solution (e.g., solving Sudoku, N-Queens problem).
*   **Dynamic Programming (with Memoization):** Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them for the same inputs, often used in recursive solutions to improve performance.

# Queues

Queues are a fundamental linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.  The first element added to the queue is the first element removed.  Think of a queue of people waiting in line â€“ the person who arrived first is the first person served.

## Key Concepts

*   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** The element that has been in the queue the longest is the first one to be removed.
*   **Enqueue (or Push):**  Adding an element to the rear (back) of the queue.
*   **Dequeue (or Pop):** Removing the element from the front of the queue.
*   **Front (or Peek):** Retrieving the value of the front element without removing it.
*   **Rear:**  The end of the queue where elements are added.
*   **isEmpty:** Checking if the queue is empty.
*   **isFull:** Checking if the queue is full (relevant for array-based implementations with fixed size).

## Common Queue Operations

*   **enqueue(element):** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
*   **dequeue():** Removes and returns the front element of the queue. Raises an error if the queue is empty.
*   **peek():** Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.  Raises an error if the queue is empty.
*   **empty():** Returns `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Implementations

*   **Array-based:** Queues can be implemented using arrays.  A circular array is often used to avoid shifting elements when dequeueing.
*   **Linked List-based:** Queues can be implemented using linked lists.  This allows for dynamic resizing.
* **Using two Stacks**: Queue can be implemented using two stacks.

## Common Queue Applications

*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traversing graphs and trees level by level.
*   **Task Scheduling:**  Managing tasks in an operating system.
*   **Print Queues:**  Handling print jobs in a printer.
*   **Data Buffers:**  Storing data temporarily before it is processed.
* **Asynchronous Programming**

# 101. Symmetric Tree, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

## Approach(es)

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Define a helper function `isMirror(left, right)` that takes two subtrees as input.
2.  **Base Cases:**
    *   If both `left` and `right` are `None`, they are mirrors, so return `True`.
    *   If only one of `left` or `right` is `None`, they are not mirrors, so return `False`.
3.  **Check Current Nodes:**
    *   If `left.val` is not equal to `right.val`, they are not mirrors, so return `False`.
4.  **Recursive Calls:**
    *   Recursively check if the left subtree of `left` is a mirror of the right subtree of `right`: `isMirror(left.left, right.right)`.
    *   Recursively check if the right subtree of `left` is a mirror of the left subtree of `right`: `isMirror(left.right, right.left)`.
5.  **Combine Results:**
    *   Return `True` if and only if both pairs of subtrees are mirrors.

Data Structures:

*   Uses the implicit call stack for recursion.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  We visit each node once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(h) in the average case (for a balanced tree), where h is the height.
*   O(n) in the worst case (completely unbalanced tree).

Trade-offs:

*   The recursive approach is intuitive and directly reflects the problem's definition of symmetry.

### Iterative Approach (using a queue)

Algorithm:

1.  If the root is `None`, the tree is symmetric (empty), so return `True`.
2.  Initialize a queue with a tuple containing the left and right children of the root: `queue = deque([(root.left, root.right)])`.
3.  While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a pair of nodes (`left`, `right`) from the queue.
    *   **Base Cases/Checks:**
        *   If both `left` and `right` are `None`, continue to the next iteration (this pair is symmetric).
        *   If only one of `left` or `right` is `None`, the tree is not symmetric, so return `False`.
        *   If `left.val` is not equal to `right.val`, the tree is not symmetric, so return `False`.
    *   **Enqueue Children:**
        *   Enqueue the pair (`left.left`, `right.right`) to compare the outer nodes.
        *   Enqueue the pair (`left.right`, `right.left`) to compare the inner nodes.
4.  If the loop completes without returning `False`, the tree is symmetric, so return `True`.

Data Structures:

*   A queue (using `collections.deque` for efficiency).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is enqueued and dequeued at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes.  This occurs when the tree is a complete binary tree, and the queue will hold all nodes at the last level. In a balanced tree the space complexity is O(w) where w is the maximum width of the tree.

Trade-offs:

*   The iterative approach avoids recursion and uses a queue to process nodes level by level. While it has the same time complexity as the recursive approach, the space complexity can be O(n) in the worst-case (full binary tree).

[Recursive Approach](./solution_recursive.py)

[Iterative Approach](./solution_iterative.py)

## Notes

Both the recursive and iterative solutions are efficient. The recursive solution is generally considered more readable for tree problems, while the iterative solution can be useful if you want to avoid potential stack overflow issues with very deep trees (though for this problem, the constraints limit the tree depth).  The key idea in both approaches is to compare corresponding nodes in the left and right subtrees to check for the mirror property.
