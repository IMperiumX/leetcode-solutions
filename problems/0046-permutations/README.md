Okay, let's break this down into the steps outlined and generate the LeetCode solution structure.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order. ... (rest of the problem description) ...`."

*   **Output:** `Problem Number: 46, Problem Name: Permutations, Difficulty: Medium`

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0046-permutations`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2:** (Since no solution was provided, we use 3.2) "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Permutations` (Number: `46`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`..."  We'll generate two common approaches: backtracking (recursive) and iterative.

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []

        def backtrack(current_permutation, remaining_nums):
            if not remaining_nums:
                result.append(current_permutation.copy())  # Append a copy to avoid modification
                return

            for i in range(len(remaining_nums)):
                # Choose the next number
                next_num = remaining_nums[i]

                # Add the chosen number to the current permutation
                current_permutation.append(next_num)

                # Recursively explore permutations with the remaining numbers (excluding the chosen one)
                backtrack(current_permutation, remaining_nums[:i] + remaining_nums[i+1:])

                # Backtrack: Remove the last added number to explore other possibilities
                current_permutation.pop()

        backtrack([], nums)
        return result

        queue = deque()
        queue.append(([], nums)) # (current permutation, remaining numbers)

        while queue:
            current_permutation, remaining_nums = queue.popleft()

            if not remaining_nums:
                result.append(current_permutation)
                continue

            for i in range(len(remaining_nums)):
                next_num = remaining_nums[i]
                new_permutation = current_permutation + [next_num]
                new_remaining = remaining_nums[:i] + remaining_nums[i+1:]
                queue.append((new_permutation, new_remaining))

        return result

```

*   **File: `0046-permutations/README.md`**

# 46. Permutations, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [[1]]

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= nums.length <= 6
*   -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
*   All the integers of nums are unique.

## Approach(es)

### Recursive Backtracking Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Base Case:** If there are no remaining numbers to choose from, add the current permutation to the result list.  It's crucial to add a *copy* of the current permutation, as the list is modified during the backtracking process.
2.  **Recursive Step:** Iterate through the remaining numbers. For each number:
    *   Add the number to the current permutation.
    *   Recursively call the backtrack function with the updated permutation and the remaining numbers (excluding the currently chosen number).
    *   Remove the last added number from the current permutation (backtracking step) to explore other possibilities.

**Data Structures:**

*   List to store the current permutation.
*   List to store the final result (list of permutations).

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n!), where n is the number of elements in the input array.  This is because there are n! possible permutations. For each permutation, we do O(n) work to create a copy for the result.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n!), primarily due to the space required to store the result (all permutations).  The recursion depth is also O(n), contributing to the space complexity, but it's dominated by the result storage.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is relatively concise and easy to understand. The main trade-off is the exponential time and space complexity, which is inherent to the problem of generating all permutations.

### Iterative Approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a queue with an empty permutation and the original list of numbers.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a permutation and its remaining numbers.
   - If there are no remaining numbers, add the permutation to the result.
   - Iterate through the remaining numbers:
     - Create a new permutation by appending the current number to the dequeued permutation.
     - Create a new list of remaining numbers by excluding the current number.
     - Enqueue the new permutation and remaining numbers.

**Data Structures:**
* Queue (using `collections.deque` for efficiency)

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n!), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n!), due to the result list.  The queue can also hold a significant number of intermediate permutations, contributing to the space complexity.

**Trade-offs:**

* The iterative approach, while having the same time/space complexity, avoids explicit recursion.  However, it can be slightly less intuitive to grasp than the backtracking approach.

# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time. It's like exploring a maze: you try different paths, and if you hit a dead end, you backtrack to the last decision point and try a different path.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Choices:** At each step, there are multiple choices or options to consider.
2.  **Constraints:** There are rules or conditions that limit the valid choices.
3.  **Goal:**  A condition that indicates a complete, valid solution.

**General Structure of a Backtracking Algorithm:**

```python
def backtrack(candidate):
    if is_solution(candidate):
        add_to_result(candidate)
        return

    for choice in get_choices(candidate):
        if is_valid(choice, candidate):
            make_choice(candidate, choice)  # Modify the candidate
            backtrack(candidate)
            undo_choice(candidate, choice) # Restore the candidate to its previous state
```

*   `is_solution(candidate)`: Checks if the current `candidate` is a complete solution.
*   `get_choices(candidate)`: Returns a list of possible choices to extend the `candidate`.
*   `is_valid(choice, candidate)`: Checks if a `choice` is valid given the current `candidate` and constraints.
*   `make_choice(candidate, choice)`: Modifies the `candidate` by applying the `choice`.
*   `undo_choice(candidate, choice)`: Reverts the modification made by `make_choice`, essential for exploring other possibilities.

**Example: Permutations (LeetCode 46)**

The Permutations problem is a classic example of backtracking.

*   **Choices:**  At each step, we choose a number from the remaining (unused) numbers.
*   **Constraints:** We can't use the same number twice in a single permutation.
*   **Goal:** We have used all numbers, creating a complete permutation.

# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science.  They store a collection of elements of the *same data type*, accessed using an index (typically an integer).

**Key Properties:**

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient access to elements using their index.
*   **Fixed Size (in many languages):**  In languages like C, C++, and Java, arrays often have a fixed size determined at compile time.  Dynamic arrays (like Python lists) can resize, but this comes with a performance cost.
*   **Zero-Based Indexing (usually):**  Most programming languages use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
*   **Homogeneous Data Type:**  All elements in an array are typically of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all strings).  Some languages (like Python) allow for heterogeneous lists, but these are technically not "arrays" in the strictest sense.

**Common Operations and Time Complexities:**

*   **Access (by index):** O(1) - Constant time, due to contiguous memory.
*   **Insertion (at the end, for dynamic arrays):**  Amortized O(1) - Usually fast, but can be O(n) if resizing is required.
*   **Insertion (at a specific index):** O(n) - Requires shifting elements to make space.
*   **Deletion (at a specific index):** O(n) - Requires shifting elements to fill the gap.
*   **Search (unsorted array):** O(n) - Linear search.
*   **Search (sorted array):** O(log n) - Binary search.

**Python Lists:**

Python's `list` data type is a dynamic array. It provides flexibility (resizing, heterogeneous elements) but can be less memory-efficient than fixed-size arrays in other languages.
