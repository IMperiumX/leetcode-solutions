# Stacks

Stacks are a fundamental linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.  The last element added to the stack is the first element removed.  Think of a stack of plates – you add plates to the top and remove plates from the top.

## Key Concepts

*   **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** The element most recently added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
*   **Push:**  Adding an element to the top of the stack.
*   **Pop:** Removing the element from the top of the stack.
*   **Peek (or Top):**  Retrieving the value of the top element without removing it.
*   **isEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
*   **isFull:** Checking if the stack is full (relevant for array-based implementations with a fixed size).

## Common Stack Operations

*   **push(element):** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
*   **pop():** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
*   **peek():** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.  Raises an error if the stack is empty.
*   **empty():** Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Implementations

*   **Array-based:** Stacks can be implemented using arrays.  In this case, the stack has a fixed capacity.
*   **Linked List-based:** Stacks can also be implemented using linked lists.  This allows for dynamic resizing.  Each node in the linked list represents an element in the stack.

## Common Stack Applications

*   **Function Call Stack:**  Used by programming languages to manage function calls.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:**  Storing previous states of an application.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Evaluating arithmetic expressions (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
*   **Backtracking Algorithms:**  Exploring different solution paths (e.g., solving mazes).
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Traversing graphs and trees.

# Queues

Queues are a fundamental linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.  The first element added to the queue is the first element removed.  Think of a queue of people waiting in line – the person who arrived first is the first person served.

## Key Concepts

*   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** The element that has been in the queue the longest is the first one to be removed.
*   **Enqueue (or Push):**  Adding an element to the rear (back) of the queue.
*   **Dequeue (or Pop):** Removing the element from the front of the queue.
*   **Front (or Peek):** Retrieving the value of the front element without removing it.
*   **Rear:**  The end of the queue where elements are added.
*   **isEmpty:** Checking if the queue is empty.
*   **isFull:** Checking if the queue is full (relevant for array-based implementations with fixed size).

## Common Queue Operations

*   **enqueue(element):** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
*   **dequeue():** Removes and returns the front element of the queue. Raises an error if the queue is empty.
*   **peek():** Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.  Raises an error if the queue is empty.
*   **empty():** Returns `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Implementations

*   **Array-based:** Queues can be implemented using arrays.  A circular array is often used to avoid shifting elements when dequeueing.
*   **Linked List-based:** Queues can be implemented using linked lists.  This allows for dynamic resizing.
* **Using two Stacks**: Queue can be implemented using two stacks.

## Common Queue Applications

*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traversing graphs and trees level by level.
*   **Task Scheduling:**  Managing tasks in an operating system.
*   **Print Queues:**  Handling print jobs in a printer.
*   **Data Buffers:**  Storing data temporarily before it is processed.
* **Asynchronous Programming**

# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

*   You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

Example 1:

Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

Constraints:

*   1 <= x <= 9
*   At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
*   All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is *amortized* O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing *n* operations will take overall O(*n*) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

## Approach(es)

### Amortized O(1) Two-Stack Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Use two stacks: `in_stack` and `out_stack`.
2.  **Push (enqueue):**  Always push new elements onto `in_stack`.
3.  **Pop (dequeue):**
    *   If `out_stack` is empty, transfer all elements from `in_stack` to `out_stack` by popping from `in_stack` and pushing onto `out_stack`. This reverses the order, making the oldest element (front of the queue) the top of `out_stack`.
    *   Pop and return the top element from `out_stack`.
4.  **Peek:**
    *   If `out_stack` is empty, transfer all elements from `in_stack` to `out_stack` (same as in pop).
    *   Return the top element of `out_stack` without popping.
5.  **Empty:**  The queue is empty if and only if both `in_stack` and `out_stack` are empty.

Data Structures:

*   Two stacks (`in_stack` and `out_stack`).

Time Complexity:

*   **Push:** O(1).
*   **Pop:** Amortized O(1).  In the worst case, we transfer all elements from `in_stack` to `out_stack`, which takes O(n) time.  However, this happens only when `out_stack` is empty.  Each element is transferred only once, so over *n* operations, the total cost of transfers is O(n), making the amortized cost per pop O(1).
*   **Peek:**  Amortized O(1). Same reasoning as pop.
*   **Empty:** O(1).

Space Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. We store all elements in the stacks.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach achieves amortized O(1) time complexity for all operations, which is optimal. It uses extra space for the second stack.  The key idea is that we only move elements from `in_stack` to `out_stack` when necessary, avoiding repeated transfers.

## Code

[Amortized O(1) Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes

The follow-up question about amortized O(1) complexity is crucial.  A naive approach of simply pushing onto one stack and popping from the other would result in O(n) complexity for pop and peek in the worst case. The two-stack approach with the "lazy" transfer to `out_stack` is what achieves the desired amortized performance.
