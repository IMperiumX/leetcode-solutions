# 8. String to Integer (atoi), Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  **Whitespace:** Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2.  **Signedness:** Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither is present.
3.  **Conversion:** Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4.  **Rounding:** If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1], then clamp the integer to remain in the range.  Specifically, integers less than -2<sup>31</sup> should be clamped to -2<sup>31</sup>, and integers greater than 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 should be clamped to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1.
5.  Return the integer as the final result.

Example 1:

Input: s = "42"
Output: 42

Example 2:

Input: s = "   -42"
Output: -42

Example 3:

Input: s = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193

Example 4:
Input: s = "words and 987"
Output: 0

Example 5:
Input: s = "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648

Constraints:

*   0 <= s.length <= 200
*   s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

## Approach(es)

### Step-by-Step Parsing

Algorithm:

1.  **Remove Leading/Trailing Whitespace:** Use `s.strip()` to remove any leading and trailing whitespace characters.
2.  **Handle Empty String:** If the string is empty after stripping, return 0.
3.  **Determine Sign:** Check the first character after whitespace removal:
    *   If it's '-', set `sign = -1`.
    *   If it's '+', set `sign = 1` (or leave it as the default 1).
    *   Increment the index `i` to move past the sign character (if present).
4.  **Iterate and Convert:** Iterate through the remaining characters as long as they are digits:
    *   Convert the current character to an integer: `digit = int(s[i])`.
    *   **Overflow/Underflow Check:** *Before* multiplying the current `result` by 10, check if doing so would cause an overflow or underflow.  This is crucial for handling the clamping requirement.  We compare `result` with `(2**31 - 1) // 10` because multiplying `result` by 10 might exceed the maximum value before we can check.  We also handle the edge case where `result` is exactly `(2**31 - 1) // 10`.
    *   If overflow/underflow is detected, return `2**31 - 1` for positive overflow or `-2**31` for negative overflow.
    *   Otherwise, update `result`: `result = result * 10 + digit`.
    *   Increment the index `i`.
5.  **Return Result:** Return `sign * result`.

Data Structures:

*   No extra data structures are used beyond a few integer variables.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is efficient and directly implements the requirements of the `atoi` function. The key is the careful handling of whitespace, sign, and especially the overflow/underflow checks.
* The order of checks are also important (whitespace, sign, digits).

# String

Strings are sequences of characters. They are fundamental data types in most programming languages and are used to represent text.

## Key Concepts

*   **Characters:** The individual elements of a string. Characters are often represented using Unicode or ASCII encoding.
*   **Immutability (in many languages):** In languages like Python and Java, strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.  Operations that appear to modify a string actually create a new string. In C++, strings (`std::string`) are mutable.
*   **Indexing:** Accessing individual characters using their position (index). Indexing typically starts at 0.
*   **Slicing:** Extracting a portion (substring) of a string using a range of indices.
*   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together to create a new string.
*   **Length:** The number of characters in the string.
* **String interning**: is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value, which must be immutable.
