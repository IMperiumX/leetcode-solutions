# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the *minimum element* of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   1 <= n <= 5000
*   -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between 1 and `n` times.

## Approach(es)

### Binary Search

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `len(nums) - 1`.
2.  While `left < right`:
    *   Calculate the middle index: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
    *   **Key Comparison:** Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]`.
        *   If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`: This indicates that the minimum element is in the right half of the array (because the right half is unsorted).  Set `left = mid + 1`.
        *   Else (`nums[mid] <= nums[right]`): This indicates that the minimum element is in the left half of the array (including `mid` itself, as `mid` could be the minimum). Set `right = mid`.
3.  After the loop finishes, `left` and `right` will both point to the index of the minimum element. Return `nums[left]`.

Data Structures:

*   None (we're working directly with the input array).

Time Complexity:

*   O(log n): Binary search halves the search space in each step.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1):  We're using only a constant amount of extra space.

Trade-offs:

-   Binary search provides the required O(log n) time complexity, making it very efficient for large arrays.
-   The logic requires careful consideration of the rotation point and how it affects the sorted nature of the array segments.

## Notes (Optional)

*   The key to solving this problem efficiently is understanding how the rotation affects the sorted order.  The comparison `nums[mid] > nums[right]` is the core of the solution.
*   If the array were *not* rotated, the minimum element would simply be `nums[0]`. The rotation introduces a "discontinuity" in the sorted order, which we exploit with binary search.
*   This problem is a variation of the classic binary search, adapted to handle the rotated nature of the input.
* A common mistake is to compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[left]`. This can lead to incorrect results because if the left part is sorted we don't know about the min in that part, we only know if right is sorted or not.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The main topic for this problem is:

1.  **Binary Search:**  The core algorithm used.

We'll reuse `Binary_Search.md` we have created before and add this problem to it.

# Binary Search
## Explanation
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a *sorted* array (or list). It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the middle element is the target, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the interval is empty.

Key Concepts:

- **Sorted Input:** Binary search *requires* the input array to be sorted.
- **Divide and Conquer:**  The search space is repeatedly halved.
- **Logarithmic Time Complexity:** Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it very efficient for large datasets.
- **Left, Right, and Middle Pointers:**  Used to track the search interval.

Algorithm (Iterative):

1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. While `left <= right`:
    - Calculate the middle index: `mid = (left + right) // 2`
    - If `arr[mid] == target`: return `mid`
    - If `arr[mid] < target`:  `left = mid + 1`
    - If `arr[mid] > target`:  `right = mid - 1`
3. If the loop finishes without finding the target, return -1 (or an appropriate indicator that the target is not present).
## Example (Python):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Integer division
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage
arr = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target = 11
index = binary_search(arr, target)
print(index)
```
```python
#Using bisect module
import bisect
arr = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target = 11
index = bisect.bisect_left(arr,target)
if index < len(arr) and arr[index] == target:
    print(index)
else:
    print(-1) #Target not found

```
