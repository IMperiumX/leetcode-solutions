# Graphs

Graphs are a fundamental non-linear data structure used to represent relationships between objects.  They consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.  Graphs are incredibly versatile and are used to model a wide range of problems, from social networks to transportation networks to course schedules.

## Key Concepts

*   **Node (Vertex):**  A fundamental unit of a graph, representing an object or entity.
*   **Edge:** A connection between two nodes, representing a relationship.
*   **Directed Graph (Digraph):**  Edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship (e.g., course prerequisites).
*   **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction, indicating a two-way relationship (e.g., friendship on a social network).
*   **Weighted Graph:** Edges have associated weights (costs, distances, etc.).
*   **Unweighted Graph:** Edges have no weights.
*   **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same node.
*   **Path:** A sequence of nodes connected by edges.
*   **Connected Graph:**  There is a path between any two nodes in the graph.
*   **Disconnected Graph:**  There are at least two nodes with no path between them.
*   **Strongly Connected Graph (for directed graphs):**  There is a directed path between any two nodes.
*   **Weakly Connected Graph (for directed graphs):**  If we ignore the direction of the edges, there is a path between any two nodes.
*   **Adjacency Matrix:** A 2D array representation of a graph, where `matrix[i][j]` indicates whether there is an edge between node `i` and node `j`.
*   **Adjacency List:**  A list-based representation where each node stores a list of its adjacent nodes.

## Common Graph Operations

*   **Add Node:**  Adding a new node to the graph.
*   **Add Edge:** Adding a new edge between two nodes.
*   **Remove Node:** Removing a node and its associated edges.
*   **Remove Edge:** Removing an edge between two nodes.
*   **Check if Edge Exists:**  Determining if there is an edge between two nodes.
*   **Get Neighbors:** Retrieving the list of nodes adjacent to a given node.

## Common Graph Algorithms

*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  A traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.  Uses a stack (often implicitly via recursion).
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level.  Uses a queue.
*   **Topological Sort (for Directed Acyclic Graphs - DAGs):**  A linear ordering of nodes such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A comes before node B in the ordering.
*   **Shortest Path Algorithms:**
    *   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
    *   **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**  Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph that may contain negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).
    *   **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**  Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.
*   **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms:**
    *   **Prim's Algorithm:**  Finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted, undirected graph.
    *   **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted, undirected graph.
*   **Cycle Detection:** Determining if a graph contains cycles (important for many applications).

# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's a fundamental algorithm used in many graph-related problems.

## Key Concepts

*   **Traversal:** DFS systematically visits all reachable nodes in a graph.
*   **Recursion (or Explicit Stack):** DFS is typically implemented recursively, which implicitly uses the call stack.  It can also be implemented iteratively using an explicit stack.
*   **Visited Set:**  A data structure (usually a set or an array) is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant visits.
*   **Backtracking:** When DFS reaches a node with no unvisited neighbors, it backtracks to the previous node and explores other branches.

## Algorithm (Recursive)

1.  **Start Node:** Choose a starting node.
2.  **Mark Visited:** Mark the current node as visited.
3.  **Explore Neighbors:** For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
4.  **Backtrack:**  Once all neighbors have been explored, the function returns (backtracks).

## Algorithm (Iterative - using a stack)

1.  **Start Node:** Choose a starting node.
2.  **Initialize Stack:** Create an empty stack and push the starting node onto it.
3.  **Mark Visited Set** Initialize a visited set
4.  **Iterate:** While the stack is not empty:
    *   Pop a node from the stack.
    *   If the node has not been visited:
        *   Mark the node as visited.
        *   Push all unvisited neighbors of the node onto the stack.

## Applications of DFS

*   **Cycle Detection:**  Detecting cycles in a graph.
*   **Topological Sorting:** Finding a linear ordering of nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
*   **Path Finding:** Finding a path between two nodes.
*   **Connectivity Checking:** Determining if a graph is connected.
*   **Solving Mazes and Puzzles:** Exploring possible solutions in a systematic way.
*   **Tree Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder):**  DFS forms the basis of these tree traversal methods.

## Advantages of DFS

*   **Simple Implementation:**  Relatively easy to implement, especially recursively.
*   **Memory Efficiency (in some cases):** For tree-like structures, DFS can use less memory than BFS.
* **Detecting cycles**

## Disadvantages of DFS

*   **Not Optimal for Shortest Paths:** DFS does not guarantee finding the shortest path between two nodes.  BFS is better suited for that purpose.
*   **Can Get Stuck in Deep Branches:**  In very large or infinite graphs, DFS might get stuck exploring a very deep branch without finding a solution.

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level. It starts at a source node and visits all its immediate neighbors before moving on to their neighbors, and so on. BFS is fundamental for many graph algorithms.

## Key Concepts

*   **Traversal:** BFS systematically visits all reachable nodes in a graph.
*   **Queue:** BFS uses a queue data structure to maintain the order of nodes to visit.
*   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores nodes in layers, visiting all nodes at a given distance from the source node before moving to nodes that are farther away.
*   **Visited Set:**  A data structure (usually a set or an array) is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant visits.

## Algorithm

1.  **Start Node:** Choose a starting node (source node).
2.  **Initialize Queue:** Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting node.
3.  **Mark Visited:** Mark the starting node as visited.
4.  **Iterate:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
    *   For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
        *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
        *   Enqueue the neighbor.

## Applications of BFS

*   **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):**  BFS finds the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an unweighted graph.
*   **Connectivity Checking:**  Determining if a graph is connected.
*   **Level Order Traversal (Trees):**  Visiting all nodes of a tree level by level.
*   **Finding Minimum Depth of Binary Tree**
*   **Web Crawling:**  Exploring web pages by following links.
* **Network Broadcasting**
* **Social Network Analysis**

## Advantages of BFS

*   **Finds Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** Guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
*   **Complete:**  Will always find a solution if one exists (in a finite graph).

## Disadvantages of BFS

*   **Memory Usage:** Can use more memory than DFS, especially for graphs with high branching factors (many neighbors per node), as it needs to store all nodes at a given level in the queue.

# Topological Sort

Topological sorting is an algorithm for ordering the nodes of a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering. In simpler terms, it's a way to linearly order the vertices of a DAG so that all dependencies are respected.

## Key Concepts

*   **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):**  A directed graph with no cycles.  Topological sort is only possible on DAGs.
*   **Dependency:**  A directed edge from node A to node B indicates that A is a dependency of B (B depends on A).  In the context of course scheduling, this means course A must be taken before course B.
*   **Linear Ordering:**  The result of a topological sort is a linear sequence of the nodes.
*   **Not Unique:**  A DAG may have multiple valid topological orderings.

## Algorithms for Topological Sorting

There are two primary algorithms for topological sorting:

1.  **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based):**
    *   **In-degree:**  The number of incoming edges to a node.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  Compute the in-degree of all nodes.
        2.  Enqueue all nodes with an in-degree of 0 (nodes with no dependencies).
        3.  While the queue is not empty:
            *   Dequeue a node.
            *   Add the dequeued node to the topological ordering.
            *   For each neighbor of the dequeued node:
                *   Decrement its in-degree.
                *   If the neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, enqueue it.
        4.  If all nodes have been added to the ordering, the topological sort is successful.  Otherwise, the graph contains a cycle.

2.  **DFS-based:**
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  Perform DFS on the graph.
        2.  As each node finishes (all its descendants have been visited), add it to the *beginning* of a list (or the end, and then reverse).  This ensures that a node is added to the list only after all its dependencies have been added.

## Applications of Topological Sorting

*   **Course Scheduling:** Determining a valid order to take courses with prerequisites.
*   **Task Scheduling:**  Scheduling tasks with dependencies (e.g., in project management).
*   **Build Systems:**  Determining the order to compile files in a software project.
*   **Dependency Resolution:**  Resolving dependencies between software packages.
*   **Dataflow Analysis:**  Analyzing the flow of data in a program.

# 207. Course Schedule, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to `numCourses` - 1. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

## Approach(es)

### Depth-First Search (DFS) with Cycle Detection

Algorithm:

1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Create an adjacency list to represent the graph, where `adj[i]` is a list of courses that depend on course `i` (courses that have `i` as a prerequisite).
2.  **Visited Array:**  Create a `visited` array to track the visitation status of each course during DFS.  Use three states:
    *   0: Unvisited
    *   1: Currently visiting (in the current DFS path)
    *   2: Visited (and all its descendants have been visited)
3.  **DFS Function:**  Create a recursive `dfs(course)` function:
    *   **Cycle Detection:** If `visited[course]` is 1 (currently visiting), a cycle is detected, so return `False`.
    *   **Already Visited:** If `visited[course]` is 2 (already visited), return `True` (no cycle found in this branch).
    *   **Mark Visiting:** Mark `visited[course]` as 1 (currently visiting).
    *   **Explore Neighbors:** For each `neighbor` in `adj[course]`, recursively call `dfs(neighbor)`.  If any recursive call returns `False` (cycle detected), return `False`.
    *   **Mark Visited:** Mark `visited[course]` as 2 (visited).
    *   **Return True:** Return `True` (no cycle found in this branch).
4.  **Iterate and Check:** Iterate through all courses (from 0 to `numCourses` - 1).  For each course, if it hasn't been visited yet, call `dfs(course)`. If `dfs` returns `False` at any point, return `False` (a cycle exists).
5.  **Return True:** If all DFS calls return `True` (no cycles found), return `True`.

Data Structures:

*   Adjacency List (list of lists) to represent the graph.
*   `visited` array (list) to track node visitation status.

Time Complexity:

*   O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (`numCourses`) and E is the number of prerequisites (`len(prerequisites)`).  We visit each node and edge at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(V + E) in the worst case, for the adjacency list and the recursion stack.  In the worst case, the recursion depth could be V.

Trade-offs:

*   The DFS approach is a classic way to detect cycles in a directed graph. It's relatively straightforward to implement.
### Topological Sort using Kahn's Algorithm(BFS):

Algorithm:
    1. Build Adjacency List and calculate in-degrees: Represent the course dependencies as a directed graph using an adjacency list. Simultaneously, calculate the in-degree of each course (the number of prerequisites it has).
    2. Initialize Queue: Create a queue and add all courses with an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites).
    3. Process Queue: While the queue is not empty.
        Remove a course from the queue.
        Increment a counter that tracks the number of processed courses.
        For each neighbor (course that depends on the current course) in the adjacency list:
            Decrement its in-degree.
            If the neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
    4. Check for Cycle: If the count of processed courses equals numCourses, it means all courses could be taken in a valid order, and there is no cycle. Return true.
    Otherwise, there is a cycle, and it's impossible to finish all courses. Return false.

Data Structures:
    *   Adjacency List
    *  Queue
    * In-Degree array

Time Complexity:

*   O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (`numCourses`) and E is the number of prerequisites (`len(prerequisites)`).

Space Complexity:

*    O(V + E) for the adjacency list, in-degree array and the queue.

Trade-offs:
    * The BFS approach usually a good alternative for DFS

[Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm - BFS)](./solution_bfs.py)

## Notes

This problem is a fundamental graph problem that can be solved using either DFS or BFS. The DFS approach directly detects cycles, while the BFS approach (Kahn's Algorithm) performs a topological sort, and the ability to complete the sort implies the absence of cycles. Both methods are efficient and have the same time and space complexity.
