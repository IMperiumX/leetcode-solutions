## Problem Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Approach(es)

### Recursive Approach (with Memoization)

Algorithm:

1.  Define a recursive function `climb(i)` that represents the number of ways to reach the top from step `i`.
2.  **Base Cases:**
    *   If `i > n`, we've gone past the top, so return 0.
    *   If `i == n`, we've reached the top, so return 1.
3.  **Recursive Step:**
    *   The number of ways to reach the top from step `i` is the sum of the ways to reach the top from step `i+1` (taking 1 step) and the ways to reach the top from step `i+2` (taking 2 steps).
    *   `climb(i) = climb(i + 1) + climb(i + 2)`
4.  **Memoization:**
    *   Use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of `climb(i)` for each `i`.  Before making a recursive call, check if the result is already in `memo`. If so, return the stored value.  This avoids redundant calculations.
5. Call `climb(0)` which represents starting from bottom.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (for memoization)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), as we calculate `climb(i)` for each `i` from 0 to n at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) for the `memo` dictionary and the recursion call stack.

Trade-offs:
* It is easy to implement, but can have stack overflow in case of large input.

### Dynamic Programming (Tabulation)

Algorithm:

1.  Create a DP table `dp` of size `n+1`. `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to reach step `i`.
2.  **Base Cases:**
    *   `dp[1] = 1` (1 way to reach step 1)
    *   `dp[2] = 2` (2 ways to reach step 2)
3.  Iterate from `i = 3` to `n`:
    *   `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]` (The number of ways to reach step `i` is the sum of ways to reach step `i-1` and step `i-2`)
4.  Return `dp[n]`.

Data Structures:

*   Array (DP table)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the DP table once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - We use a DP table of size `n+1`.

Trade-offs:

*   The dynamic programming approach avoids recursion and is generally more efficient.

### Dynamic Programming (Optimized Space)

Algorithm:

1.  Notice that in the tabulation approach, we only need to keep track of the previous two values (`dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`) to calculate the current value (`dp[i]`).
2.  Instead of using a full DP table, we can use just three variables:
    *   `prev1`: Stores the number of ways to reach the previous step (i-1)
    *   `prev2`: Stores the number of ways to reach the step before the previous (i-2)
    *   `current`: Stores the number of ways to reach the current step (i)
3.  Initialize `prev1 = 2` and `prev2 = 1` (base cases for n=2 and n=1).
4.  Iterate from 3 to n:
     * current = prev1 + prev2
     * prev2 = prev1
     * prev1 = current
5. Return 'current'.

Data Structures:
* No need for extra data structure.

Time Complexity:

* O(n)

Space Complexity:

* O(1) - We use only a constant amount of extra space.

Trade-offs:
* Space complexity is reduced to O(1).

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

## Key Concepts

*   **Overlapping Subproblems:** The problem can be divided into subproblems that are reused multiple times.
*   **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

## Approaches to Dynamic Programming

*   **Memoization (Top-Down):**  A recursive approach where we store the results of subproblems in a table (usually a dictionary or array) to avoid recomputing them.
*   **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** An iterative approach where we build a table (usually an array) bottom-up, starting from the base cases and working our way up to the desired solution.

## Steps to Solve a DP Problem

1.  **Identify Overlapping Subproblems:** Determine if the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved repeatedly.
2.  **Define the Recurrence Relation:** Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems. This is often expressed as a recursive formula.
3.  **Determine Base Cases:** Identify the smallest subproblems that can be solved directly without further recursion.
4.  **Choose Memoization or Tabulation:** Decide whether to use a top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approach.
5.  **Implement the Solution:** Write the code based on the chosen approach, either recursively with memoization or iteratively with tabulation.

## Advantages of Dynamic Programming

*   **Efficiency:** DP can significantly reduce the time complexity of problems with overlapping subproblems, often from exponential to polynomial.
*   **Optimality:** DP guarantees finding the optimal solution for problems with optimal substructure.

## Disadvantages of Dynamic Programming

*   **Memory Usage:** DP often requires extra memory to store the solutions to subproblems (the memoization table or tabulation table).
*   **Complexity:**  DP problems can sometimes be challenging to formulate and implement, especially for beginners.
