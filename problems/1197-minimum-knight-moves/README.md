    # 1197. Minimum Knight Moves, Difficulty: Medium

    ## Problem Description

    In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

    A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

    Return the *minimum* number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y]. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

    Example 1:

    Input: x = 2, y = 1
    Output: 1
    Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]

    Example 2:

    Input: x = 5, y = 5
    Output: 4
    Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]

    Constraints:

    -300 <= x, y <= 300
    0 <= |x| + |y| <= 300

    ## Approach(es)

    ### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

    Algorithm:

    1.  **Initialization:**
        *   Define `moves`: A list of tuples representing the 8 possible knight moves (dx, dy).
        *   Create a `queue` (using `collections.deque` for efficient popping from both ends) to store the positions to visit, starting with `(0, 0, 0)` (initial x, y, and steps).
        *   Create a `visited` set to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles and redundant explorations.  Initialize it with `(0, 0)`.
        *    Apply symmetry by taking the absolute values of x and y.

    2.  **BFS Iteration:**
        *   While the `queue` is not empty:
            *   Dequeue the current position `(curr_x, curr_y, steps)` from the front of the `queue`.
            *   **Goal Check:** If `curr_x` equals `x` and `curr_y` equals `y`, we've reached the target, so return `steps`.
            *   **Explore Neighbors:** For each possible knight move `(dx, dy)` in `moves`:
                *   Calculate the next position: `next_x = curr_x + dx`, `next_y = curr_y + dy`.
                *   **Validity Check:** Check if `(next_x, next_y)` is within a reasonable bound (e.g. not visited and within the range that can lead the solution) and hasn't been visited before.
                *   If the next position is valid:
                    *   Add `(next_x, next_y)` to the `visited` set.
                    *   Enqueue `(next_x, next_y, steps + 1)` to the `queue`, adding 1 to the steps count.
    3. Return -1 (this line should ideally be unreachable).

    Data Structures:

    -   Queue (using `collections.deque`): For storing positions to visit in BFS order.
    -   Set (using `set`): For efficient checking of visited positions (O(1) lookup).

    Time Complexity:

    -   O(max(|x|, |y|)^2). In the worst case, we might visit a constant multiple of a grid that's approximately |x| by |y| in size.  The branching factor is 8 (the number of knight moves), but the visited set prevents revisiting, so the overall complexity is related to the area explored. The optimization reduces the constants involved significantly by restricting the exploration area.

    Space Complexity:

    -   O(max(|x|, |y|)^2). The `visited` set and the `queue` can store, at most, a number of elements proportional to the area explored.

    Trade-offs:

    - BFS is guaranteed to find the *shortest* path (minimum number of moves), which is exactly what the problem asks for.

    ## Code

    [BFS Approach](./solution.py)
    ## Notes (Optional)
     - The problem can be optimized using symmetry. Since the knight's moves are symmetric with respect to the x and y axes, we only need to consider the first quadrant (positive x and y values).  We take the absolute values of `x` and `y` at the beginning.

     - We added a bound check (-2 <= next_x <= x + 2 and -2 <= next_y <= y+2) as optimization, it is not necessary to explore locations too far to find the shortest way.

     - Bidirectional BFS could be another optimization.

- Topic Extraction
```markdown
# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore a graph or tree level by level.  It starts at a designated source node and visits all the node's immediate neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors.

Key Characteristics:

-   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph in layers, visiting all nodes at a given distance from the source before moving to nodes that are further away.
-   **Queue-Based:** BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit.
-   **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path between the source node and any other reachable node in an *unweighted* graph (or a graph where all edges have the same weight).
-   **Completeness:** BFS is complete, meaning it will find a path to the target node if one exists.
-   **Not Suitable for Weighted Graphs (without modification):**  For weighted graphs, BFS doesn't guarantee finding the shortest path unless it's modified (e.g., using a priority queue, leading to Dijkstra's algorithm).

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a queue and enqueue the starting node.
    *   Create a set (or other data structure) to mark visited nodes. Add the starting node to the visited set.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
        *   Process the dequeued node (e.g., check if it's the target, print it, etc.).
        *   For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
            *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
            *   Enqueue the neighbor.

Use Cases:

-   **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs:** Finding the shortest path between two nodes.
-   **Level Order Traversal of Trees:** Visiting all nodes of a tree level by level.
-   **Connected Components:** Finding connected components in a graph.
-   **Web Crawling:** Exploring web pages by following links.
-   **Network Broadcasting:** Simulating the broadcast of a message to all nodes in a network.
- **Minimum Knight Moves:** Finding minimum number of moves in a chess board
