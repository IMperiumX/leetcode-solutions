Okay, let's break down this LeetCode problem and generate the solution repository.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

Based on the input "394. Decode String", we can identify:

*   **Problem Number:** 394
*   **Problem Name:** Decode String
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0394-decode-string`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since no solution was provided, I'll generate a Python solution using a stack-based approach.  I'll create two solutions, one iterative and one recursive.

```python
# 0394-decode-string/solution_iterative.py
# 394. Decode String - Iterative Stack Approach

def decodeString(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    curr_num = 0
    curr_str = ""

    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(char)
        elif char == '[':
            stack.append((curr_str, curr_num))
            curr_str = ""
            curr_num = 0
        elif char == ']':
            prev_str, num = stack.pop()
            curr_str = prev_str + curr_str * num
        elif char.isalpha():
            curr_str += char

    return curr_str
```

```python
# 0394-decode-string/solution_recursive.py
# 394. Decode String - Recursive Approach

def decodeString(s: str) -> str:
    def decode_recursive(s: str, i: int) -> tuple[str, int]:
        result = ""
        curr_num = 0

        while i < len(s):
            if s[i].isdigit():
                curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(s[i])
            elif s[i] == '[':
                decoded_str, next_i = decode_recursive(s, i + 1)
                result += decoded_str * curr_num
                curr_num = 0
                i = next_i
            elif s[i] == ']':
                return result, i
            else:
                result += s[i]
            i += 1
        return result, i

    return decode_recursive(s, 0)[0]
```

# 394. Decode String, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.

**Example 1:**

Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= s.length <= 30
*   s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'.
*   s is guaranteed to be a valid input.
*   All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].

## Approach(es)

### Iterative Stack Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty stack, `curr_num` to 0, and `curr_str` to "".
2.  Iterate through the input string `s`.
3.  If the current character is a digit, update `curr_num` by multiplying it by 10 and adding the digit.
4.  If the current character is '[', push the current `curr_str` and `curr_num` onto the stack, then reset `curr_str` and `curr_num`.
5.  If the current character is ']', pop the previous string and number from the stack.  Append the current string repeated `num` times to the previous string.
6.  If the current character is a letter, append it to `curr_str`.
7. Return curr_str.

Data Structures:

*   Stack: Used to store the previous string and number when encountering a '['.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N\*maxK), where N is the length of the string and maxK is the maximum value of k. In the worst case, we might have to expand a nested string many times.

Space Complexity:

*   O(M), where M is the length of the decoded string, to store the stack's content in the worst-case scenario.

Trade-offs:
- Iterative solutions often offer slightly better performance in practice due to avoiding function call overhead.

### Recursive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Define a recursive helper function `decode_recursive(s, i)` that takes the string `s` and the current index `i` as input.
2.  Initialize `result` to "" and `curr_num` to 0.
3.  Iterate through the string starting from index `i`.
4.  If the current character is a digit, update `curr_num`.
5.  If the current character is '[', recursively call `decode_recursive` with the substring starting from the next index.  Append the result of the recursive call multiplied by `curr_num` to the `result`.
6.  If the current character is ']', return the `result` and the current index.
7.  If the current character is a letter, append it to `result`.
8. Return result and the index of decode_recursive.

Data Structures:

*   Implicit call stack: Used during recursion.

Time Complexity:

*   O(N\*maxK), similar to the iterative approach.

Space Complexity:

*   O(M), where M is the length of the decoded string in the worst-case due to the recursive call stack.

Trade-offs:

-   Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to read for problems with a naturally recursive structure.
-   However, recursion can lead to stack overflow errors for very deep recursion levels (though unlikely in this problem's constraints).

[Recursive Approach](./solution_recursive.py)

## Notes (Optional)

-   Both the iterative and recursive solutions handle nested brackets correctly.
-   The iterative solution uses a stack explicitly, while the recursive solution uses the call stack implicitly.
```
**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The main topics related to this problem are:

1.  **Stack:**  The iterative solution utilizes a stack.
2.  **Recursion:** The recursive solution uses recursion.
3. **String Manipulation:** Both solutions involves processing and building strings.

I will generate the respective files for each topic:

# Stack

## Explanation

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.  Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates from the top. The last plate you put on is the first one you take off.

Key operations:

*   **push(item):** Adds an item to the top of the stack.
*   **pop():** Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
*   **peek():** Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
*   **is_empty():** Checks if the stack is empty.
*   **size():** Returns the number of items in the stack.

Common uses:

*   Function call management (call stack)
*   Expression evaluation (like in this problem)
*   Undo/redo functionality
*   Depth-first search (DFS) in graphs
*   Backtracking algorithms

## Example (Python):

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

# Recursion

## Explanation

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition.  A recursive function typically has two parts:

1.  **Base Case:** A condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely.
2.  **Recursive Step:** The function calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case.

Common uses:

*   Tree and graph traversals (depth-first search)
*   Divide and conquer algorithms (merge sort, quicksort)
*   Parsing (like in this problem)
*   Fractals and other self-similar structures

## Example (Python):

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive step: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

# String Manipulation
## Explanation
String manipulation refers to the various operations that can be performed on strings. This includes tasks such as:

-   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
-   **Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a string.
-   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a substring within a string.
-   **Replacing:** Replacing parts of a string with another string.
-   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
- **Formatting:** Creating strings with specific formatting (e.g., padding, alignment).
- **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of characters in a string (e.g., uppercase, lowercase).
- **Trimming:** Removing whitespace from the beginning or end of a string.

## Example in Python

```python
# Concatenation
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
combined = str1 + " " + str2  # combined is "Hello World"

# Slicing
text = "abcdefgh"
substring = text[2:5]   # substring is "cde"

# Searching
sentence = "This is a sentence."
index = sentence.find("is")  # index is 2

#Replacing
new_sentence = sentence.replace("sentence", "string")  # new_sentence is "This is a string."

#Splitting
words = sentence.split(" ") #words is ['This','is','a','sentence.']

#Formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
#Formatted string is: "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old"

#Case Conversion
upper_case = sentence.upper() #upper_case = "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

#Trimming
spaced_string = "   extra spaces   "
trimmed_string = spaced_string.strip() #"extra spaces"
```
