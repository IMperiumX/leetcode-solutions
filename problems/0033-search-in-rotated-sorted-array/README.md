Okay, let's break down this LeetCode problem and generate the requested files and content.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Output:** `Problem Number: 33, Problem Name: Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Difficulty: Medium`

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0033-search-in-rotated-sorted-array`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2:** (Since no solution was provided, we'll generate one) "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Search in Rotated Sorted Array` (Number: `33`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`,"  "If you know of multiple common approaches to solve the problem, generate separate solution files for each approach (e.g., `solution_bruteforce.py`, `solution_modified_binary_search.py`)."

*   We'll create `solution_modified_binary_search.py` inside the directory `0033-search-in-rotated-sorted-array`.  A brute-force approach would violate the O(log n) requirement, so we'll focus on the optimized binary search.

## Problem Description

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104

## Approach(es)

### Modified Binary Search

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2.  While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
    *   Calculate the middle index `mid`.
    *   If `nums[mid]` is equal to the `target`, return `mid`.
    *   Check if the left half of the array (from `left` to `mid`) is sorted:
        *   If it is, check if the `target` lies within the sorted left half.  If so, move `right` to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, move `left` to `mid + 1`.
    *   If the left half is not sorted, the right half (from `mid` to `right`) must be sorted.  Check if the `target` lies within the sorted right half. If so, move `left` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, move `right` to `mid - 1`.
3.  If the loop finishes without finding the `target`, return -1.

Data Structures:

*   No extra data structures are used besides a few integer variables for pointers.

Time Complexity:

*   O(log n), where n is the length of the input array.  Each iteration of the while loop halves the search space.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1), as we use only constant extra space.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach achieves the required O(log n) runtime complexity, making it very efficient for large arrays.  The logic is slightly more complex than a standard binary search due to the rotation.

## Code

[Modified Binary Search Approach](./solution_modified_binary_search.py)

## Notes

*   The key to solving this problem efficiently is to adapt the binary search algorithm to handle the rotation.  We determine which half of the array is sorted and adjust the search space accordingly.
*   A linear search (O(n)) would be simpler to implement but would not meet the problem's performance requirement.

# Arrays
Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science. They are collections of elements, each identified by an index or a key.
## Key Properties
- **Contiguous Memory:** Elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. This allows for efficient access to elements using their indices.
- **Fixed Size (in some languages):** In many languages like C, C++, and Java, arrays have a fixed size that must be declared beforehand. Python lists, however, are dynamic arrays.
- **Homogeneous or Heterogeneous:** Most languages enforce that arrays are homogeneous (all elements have the same data type), but some, like Python, allow heterogeneous arrays (elements can have different data types). Python lists are technically heterogeneous, although often used to store homogeneous data.
- **Zero-Based Indexing:** In most programming languages, array indexing starts at 0 (the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on).

## Common Operations and Time Complexities
- **Access (get element at index i):** O(1) - Constant time, because of contiguous memory allocation.
- **Update (set element at index i):** O(1) - Constant time.
- **Insertion (at the beginning/middle):**  Generally O(n) in the worst and average case, where n is the number of elements, as it may require shifting elements. In dynamic arrays like Python lists, insertion at the end is usually O(1) (amortized), but can be O(n) in the worst case.
- **Insertion (at the end):** O(1) for dynamic arrays (amortized) like Python lists. O(n) if resizing is needed. For fixed-size arrays, insertion isn't possible if the array is full.
- **Deletion (at the beginning/middle):** O(n), as it typically requires shifting elements.
- **Deletion (at the end):** O(1) for dynamic arrays. For fixed-size arrays, you might logically "delete" by setting the value to a default/null value, which is O(1), but the space remains allocated.
- **Search (linear search):** O(n) - In the worst case, you have to check every element.
- **Search (binary search - if the array is sorted):** O(log n)

## Dynamic Arrays (e.g., Python Lists)
Dynamic arrays, such as Python lists, automatically resize themselves as needed. This resizing operation takes O(n) time, but it happens infrequently enough that the *amortized* time complexity for appending elements is O(1).

## Use Cases
Arrays are versatile and used in countless applications, including:
- Implementing other data structures (stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables).
- Storing and manipulating data in scientific computing, image processing, and databases.
- Representing matrices and vectors in linear algebra.
- Implementing sorting and searching algorithms.

# Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a *sorted* array (or list).  It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

## Algorithm

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Set `left` to the index of the first element (usually 0).
    *   Set `right` to the index of the last element (usually `len(array) - 1`).

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While `left <= right`:
        *   Calculate the middle index: `mid = (left + right) // 2`  (integer division).
        *   Compare the target value with the element at `array[mid]`:
            *   If `target == array[mid]`:  The target is found; return `mid`.
            *   If `target < array[mid]`: The target must be in the left half.  Set `right = mid - 1`.
            *   If `target > array[mid]`: The target must be in the right half.  Set `left = mid + 1`.

3.  **Not Found:**
    *   If the loop finishes without finding the target (i.e., `left > right`), the target is not present in the array. Return -1 (or another appropriate indicator).

## Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.  Each comparison eliminates half of the remaining search space.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   **Iterative version:** O(1) - Constant space, as it only uses a few variables.
    *   **Recursive version:** O(log n) in the worst case due to the call stack.  However, many compilers can optimize tail recursion, reducing the space complexity to O(1).

## Key Features and Requirements

*   **Sorted Input:**  Binary search *requires* the input array to be sorted.  If the array is not sorted, the algorithm will not work correctly.
*   **Efficiency:**  The logarithmic time complexity makes binary search very efficient for large datasets.
*   **Direct Access:** Binary search requires direct access to elements by index (random access), which is a characteristic of arrays. It's not suitable for data structures like linked lists where accessing an element takes O(n) time.

## Example (Python)

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage:
sorted_array = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target_value = 11
index = binary_search(sorted_array, target_value)

if index != -1:
    print(f"Target {target_value} found at index {index}")  # Output: Target 11 found at index 4
else:
    print(f"Target {target_value} not found in the array")

```
## Variations

*   **Finding the first/last occurrence:**  Slight modifications can be made to find the first or last occurrence of a target value if there are duplicates.
*   **Searching in rotated sorted arrays:**  As seen in LeetCode problem 33, the core principles of binary search can be adapted to work even on rotated sorted arrays.
* **Lower bound/ Upper bound**
