def countBits(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """

        num = i
        while num > 0:
            count += num & 1  # Check the least significant bit

## Problem Description

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 105

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?

## Approach(es)

### Naive Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty list `ans`.
2.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `n`:
    *   Initialize `count = 0` (to count 1s for the current number).
    *   Initialize `num = i`.
    *   While `num > 0`:
        *   Check the least significant bit using `num & 1`. If it's 1, increment `count`.
        *   Right-shift `num` by 1 (`num >>= 1`) to process the next bit.
    *   Append `count` to `ans`.
3.  Return `ans`.

Data Structures:

*   List

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n). The outer loop runs `n` times. The inner loop (counting bits) runs a number of times proportional to the number of bits in `i`, which is O(log i) on average.  Therefore, the overall complexity is O(n log n).

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - We use a list of size `n+1` to store the results.

Trade-offs:
* Easy to implement, but not efficient.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Create a DP table `ans` of size `n + 1`, initialized with all zeros.
2.  Iterate from `i = 1` to `n`:
    *   `ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`
        *   `ans[i >> 1]` gets the number of 1s in the number `i` with its last bit removed (right-shifted by 1). This is equivalent to integer division by 2.
        *   `(i & 1)` gets the least significant bit of `i` (which is 1 if `i` is odd and 0 if `i` is even).
3.  Return `ans`.

Data Structures:

*   List (DP table)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the loop once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) -  We use a list of size `n+1` for the DP table.

Trade-offs:
* This is the most efficient approach, we reduced the complexity to O(n)

### Dynamic Programming Approach (Alternative)
Algorithm:

1. Create a DP table `ans` of size `n + 1`, initialized with all zeros.
2. Set `offset=1`.
3. Iterate from i = 1 to n:
    * If `offset * 2 == i`, then set `offset = i`.
    * `ans[i] = ans[i-offset] + 1`
4.  Return `ans`.

Data Structures:

*   List (DP table)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the loop once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) -  We use a list of size `n+1` for the DP table.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach is efficient and avoids bitwise operations.

[Dynamic Programming Approach](./solution_dp.py)

## Notes

*   The dynamic programming approach significantly improves the time complexity compared to the naive approach.
*   The key insight for the DP solution is understanding the relationship between the number of 1s in a number and the number of 1s in its right-shifted counterpart.
* The alternative DP approach exploits the pattern of bit counts related to powers of 2.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic Extraction.
*Analysis*: "Dynamic Programming" and "Bit Manipulation" are the key topics.

*   `Dynamic Programming.md`: (This was created in a previous response, we reuse it).

*   Create `Bit Manipulation.md`:

# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization.

## Basic Bitwise Operators

*   **AND (&):**  Takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits.  The result in each position is 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, the result is 0.
*   **OR (|):** Takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if at least one of the bits is 1; otherwise, the result is 0.
*   **XOR (^):**  Takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR (XOR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if the bits are different; otherwise, the result is 0.
*   **NOT (~):**  Takes one bit pattern and inverts all bits in it.  0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
*   **Left Shift (<<):**  Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.  Zeros are shifted in from the right.  Left shifting by `n` positions is equivalent to multiplying by 2^n.
*   **Right Shift (>>):**  Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
    *   **Logical Right Shift:** Zeros are shifted in from the left.
    *   **Arithmetic Right Shift:** The sign bit (most significant bit) is shifted in from the left. This preserves the sign of a signed integer. In most cases, the Right Shift implemented is the arithmetic one.

## Common Bit Manipulation Techniques

*   **Checking if a bit is set:** `(num & (1 << i)) != 0`  (Checks if the i-th bit of num is 1)
*   **Setting a bit:** `num |= (1 << i)` (Sets the i-th bit of num to 1)
*   **Clearing a bit:** `num &= ~(1 << i)` (Sets the i-th bit of num to 0)
*   **Toggling a bit:** `num ^= (1 << i)` (Flips the i-th bit of num)
*   **Getting the least significant bit (LSB):** `num & 1`
*   **Removing the least significant set bit:**  `num & (num - 1)`
*   **Checking if a number is a power of 2:** `(num > 0) && (num & (num - 1)) == 0`
*   **Counting set bits:**  Iterate through the bits or use the `num & (num - 1)` trick in a loop.
