# Trie (Prefix Tree)

A Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.  Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the trie stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated.  All descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.

## Key Concepts

*   **Nodes:** Each node in a trie typically contains:
    *   A dictionary (or other mapping) to store links to child nodes.  Each key in the dictionary represents a character, and the corresponding value is a pointer to the child node.
    *   A flag (e.g., `is_end_of_word`) to indicate whether the path from the root to this node represents a complete word.
*   **Root Node:** The root node represents the empty string.
*   **Prefix Sharing:**  Nodes that share a common prefix are represented by a shared path from the root. This is the key feature that makes tries efficient for prefix-based operations.

## Operations

*   **`insert(word)`:** Inserts a word into the trie.
    1.  Start at the root node.
    2.  For each character in the word:
        *   If the character is not a key in the current node's children dictionary, create a new child node and add it to the dictionary.
        *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
    3.  After processing all characters, mark the final node's `is_end_of_word` flag as `True`.

*   **`search(word)`:** Checks if a word is present in the trie.
    1.  Start at the root node.
    2.  For each character in the word:
        *   If the character is not a key in the current node's children dictionary, return `False` (word not found).
        *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
    3.  After processing all characters, return the value of the final node's `is_end_of_word` flag.

*   **`startsWith(prefix)`:** Checks if any word in the trie starts with the given prefix.
    1.  Start at the root node.
    2.  For each character in the prefix:
        *   If the character is not a key in the current node's children dictionary, return `False` (no words with this prefix).
        *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
    3.  After processing all characters, return `True` (at least one word starts with this prefix).

## Time Complexity

*   **`insert(word)`:** O(m), where m is the length of the word being inserted.
*   **`search(word)`:** O(m), where m is the length of the word being searched.
*   **`startsWith(prefix)`:** O(m), where m is the length of the prefix.

## Space Complexity

*   O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the trie, and m is average length of a word. The space used depends on the number of words and the degree of prefix sharing. In the worst case (no shared prefixes), each character of each word requires a separate node.

## Advantages of Tries

*   **Efficient Prefix Operations:** Very fast for operations like searching for words with a common prefix (autocomplete).
*   **Space Efficiency (for common prefixes):**  If many words share common prefixes, tries can be more space-efficient than storing the words individually.
*   **Ordered Storage:** Tries implicitly store keys in lexicographical order.

## Disadvantages of Tries

*   **Space Inefficiency (for few shared prefixes):** If the words have few common prefixes, tries can use a lot of memory, as each character might require a separate node.
*   **Not Suitable for All Key Types:**  Primarily designed for strings or sequences.

## Use Cases

*   **Autocomplete:** Suggesting words as the user types.
*   **Spell Checkers:** Identifying misspelled words.
*   **IP Routing (Longest Prefix Match):** Finding the best route for data packets based on IP addresses.
*   **T9 Text Prediction:** Predicting words on mobile phone keypads.
*   **Implementing Dictionaries:**  Storing and retrieving words efficiently.

# Hash Table

A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary, which is a collection of key-value pairs. It allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of elements based on their unique keys.  Hash tables use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## How it Works

1.  **Hash Function:**  A hash function takes a key as input and returns an integer, called a hash code.  A good hash function should:
    *   Be deterministic (same key always produces the same hash code).
    *   Distribute keys uniformly across the hash table's buckets to minimize collisions.
    *   Be computationally efficient.

2.  **Buckets:** The hash table is typically implemented as an array of buckets.  Each bucket can store one or more key-value pairs.

3.  **Collision Handling:**  When two different keys produce the same hash code (a collision), the hash table needs a mechanism to handle it.  Common methods include:
    *   **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a linked list (or other data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to that bucket.
    *   **Open Addressing:**  If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for the next available slot in the array, using techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing.

## Operations

*   **Insertion:**
    1.  Compute the hash code of the key.
    2.  Use the hash code to determine the bucket index.
    3.  Insert the key-value pair into the bucket (handling collisions as needed).

*   **Retrieval (Lookup):**
    1.  Compute the hash code of the key.
    2.  Use the hash code to determine the bucket index.
    3.  Search the bucket for the key (handling collisions as needed). If found, return the associated value.

*   **Deletion:**
    1.  Compute the hash code of the key.
    2.  Use the hash code to determine the bucket index.
    3.  Search the bucket for the key (handling collisions as needed). If found, remove the key-value pair.

## Time Complexity

*   **Average Case:** O(1) for insertion, retrieval, and deletion, assuming a good hash function and collision handling strategy.
*   **Worst Case:** O(n), where n is the number of elements, if all keys hash to the same bucket (e.g., with a very poor hash function).  In practice, with a good hash function, this is very rare.

## Space Complexity

O(n), where n is the number of elements stored in the hash table. The space used depends on the number of buckets and the collision handling method.

## Advantages

*   **Fast Lookups:**  Hash tables provide very fast average-case performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
*   **Efficient for Key-Value Data:**  Ideal for storing and retrieving data based on unique keys.

## Disadvantages

*   **Worst-Case Performance:**  Can degrade to O(n) in the worst case (though this is uncommon with good hash functions).
*   **Unordered:** Hash tables do not maintain the order of elements.
*   **Hash Function Dependence:** Performance heavily relies on the quality of the hash function.

## Use Cases

*   **Dictionaries and Associative Arrays:**  Implementing dictionaries or maps in programming languages.
*   **Caching:**  Storing recently accessed data for quick retrieval.
*   **Symbol Tables:**  Used in compilers and interpreters to store information about identifiers.
*   **Database Indexing:**  Speeding up database queries.
*   **Sets:** Implementing sets (collections of unique elements).

# 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree), Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

A *trie* (pronounced as "try") or *prefix tree* is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the `Trie` class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
*   `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // return True
trie.search("app");     // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // return True
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
*   `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
*   At most `3 * 10^4` calls in total will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.

## Approach(es)

### Standard Trie Implementation (Nested Dictionaries)

Algorithm:

1.  **TrieNode Class:**
    *   Create a `TrieNode` class to represent each node in the trie.  Each node should have:
        *   `children`: A dictionary to store child nodes.  Keys are characters, and values are `TrieNode` objects.
        *   `is_end_of_word`: A boolean flag to indicate whether this node marks the end of a valid word.
2.  **Trie Class:**
    *   `__init__(self)`: Initialize the `root` of the trie to a new `TrieNode`.
    *   `insert(self, word)`:
        *   Start at the `root` node.
        *   Iterate through the characters of the `word`:
            *   If the current character is not a key in the current node's `children` dictionary, create a new `TrieNode` and add it to the dictionary.
            *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
        *   Set the `is_end_of_word` flag of the final node to `True`.
    *   `search(self, word)`:
        *   Start at the `root` node.
        *   Iterate through the characters of the `word`:
            *   If the current character is not a key in the current node's `children` dictionary, return `False`.
            *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
        *   Return the value of the `is_end_of_word` flag of the final node.
    *   `startsWith(self, prefix)`:
        *   Start at the `root` node.
        *   Iterate through the characters of the `prefix`:
            *   If the current character is not a key in the current node's `children` dictionary, return `False`.
            *   Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
        *   Return `True` (if we reach this point, a word with the given prefix exists).

Data Structures:

*   Nested Dictionaries (within the `TrieNode` class): Used to represent the tree structure of the trie.

Time Complexity:

*   `insert`: O(m), where m is the length of the word.
*   `search`: O(m), where m is the length of the word.
*   `startsWith`: O(m), where m is the length of the prefix.

Space Complexity:

*    O(n * m), where n is the number of words in the trie, and m is average length of a word.

Trade-offs:

*   This is the standard and efficient way to implement a trie. The nested dictionary structure allows for quick lookups and insertions.

[Standard Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   Tries are particularly well-suited for problems involving prefix matching and searching.
*   The space complexity can be a concern if there are many words with little prefix overlap.
*   Alternative implementations might use arrays instead of dictionaries for the `children` if the character set is small and known (e.g., only lowercase English letters). However, dictionaries are more flexible and generally preferred in Python.
