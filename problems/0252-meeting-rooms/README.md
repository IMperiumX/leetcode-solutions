**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create directory: `0252-meeting-rooms`

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2:** Generate solutions in Python.  Since this is a "can attend all meetings" problem, we'll focus on the sorting-based approach.

*   **File: `0252-meeting-rooms/solution.py`** (Sorting Approach)

```python
# 252. Meeting Rooms - Sorting Approach

def canAttendMeetings(intervals: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if a person could attend all meetings, given a list of meeting
    time intervals.

    Args:
        intervals: A list of meeting time intervals, where each interval is a
                   list [start, end].

    Returns:
        True if the person could attend all meetings, False otherwise.
    """
    if not intervals:
        return True

    # Sort the intervals by start time
    intervals.sort()

    # Check for overlaps
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]:  # Current start < previous end
            return False  # Overlap found

    return True  # No overlaps found

```

**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4:** "Generate a `README.md` file...".  We'll fetch the problem description (simulated here, as we don't have direct web access).

# 252. Meeting Rooms, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, determine if a person could attend all meetings.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true

Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti < endi <= 106

## Approach(es)

### Sorting Approach

Algorithm:

1.  If the input `intervals` list is empty, return `True` (no meetings, so trivially attendable).
2.  Sort the `intervals` list based on the start time of each meeting.  This is crucial for efficiently checking for overlaps.
3.  Iterate through the sorted intervals, starting from the second interval (index 1):
    *   Compare the start time of the current meeting with the end time of the previous meeting.
    *   If the current meeting's start time is *before* the previous meeting's end time, there's an overlap, so return `False`.
4.  If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, return `True`.

Data Structures:

*   List of lists (for the intervals)

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n), where n is the number of meeting intervals.  The dominant factor is the sorting step.  The iteration to check for overlaps takes O(n) time, but this is less significant than the sorting time.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - We're sorting in place (Python's `list.sort()` uses Timsort, which can have O(n) space in worst case but mostly work as in-place, here we consider best/average cases), and we're not using any significant extra data structures.  If we were to create a *copy* of the intervals for sorting, the space complexity would be O(n).

Trade-offs:
* The approach used sort which is not the most efficient but easy to implement.

## Notes

*   This problem highlights the importance of sorting for efficiently solving problems involving intervals or ranges.
*   The key idea is that if we sort the meetings by start time, we only need to check for overlaps between consecutive meetings.
*   The problem can be extended to find the minimum number of meeting rooms required (LeetCode 253. Meeting Rooms II).

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic Extraction.
*Analysis:* Relevant topics are "Arrays" and "Sorting".

*   `Arrays.md`: (This was created in previous examples, we reuse it.)

*   Create a new file `Sorting.md`

# Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used in a wide range of applications.

## Common Sorting Algorithms

*   **Bubble Sort:**  Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Simple but inefficient (O(n^2)).
*   **Insertion Sort:**  Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data (O(n^2) average, O(n) best).
*   **Selection Sort:**  Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning.  Simple but inefficient (O(n^2)).
*   **Merge Sort:**  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array into halves, sorts the halves, and then merges them back together.  Efficient and stable (O(n log n)).
*   **Quicksort:**  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot.  Efficient on average (O(n log n)), but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.
*   **Heapsort:**  Uses a binary heap data structure to sort the array.  Efficient (O(n log n)) and in-place.
*   **Counting Sort:**  A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works for integers within a specific range.  Efficient (O(n + k), where k is the range of input values), but requires extra space.
*   **Radix Sort:** A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts integers digit by digit.  Efficient (O(nk), where k is the number of digits), but requires extra space.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Sorting Algorithm

*   **Time Complexity:** How the running time of the algorithm scales with the input size.
*   **Space Complexity:** How much extra memory the algorithm requires.
*   **Stability:**  A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
*   **Data Characteristics:**  Some algorithms perform better on nearly sorted data, while others perform well on randomly ordered data.
* **In-Place:** If there is no need for extra memory.
