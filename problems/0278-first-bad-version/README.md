Okay, let's create the LeetCode solution repository as requested.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** The problem description clearly matches "First Bad Version" on LeetCode. Searching confirms it's problem number 278.
*   **Output:** "Problem Number: 278, Problem Name: First Bad Version, Difficulty: Easy"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0278-first-bad-version`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

# Binary Search

Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a **sorted** array (or list). It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the middle element matches the target, the index is returned.  If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, the search continues in the right half. This process continues until the target is found or the interval is empty.

## How it Works

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Start with a sorted array `arr`.
    *   Define `left` and `right` pointers, initially pointing to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While `left <= right`:
        *   Calculate the middle index: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.  This prevents potential integer overflow that could occur with `(left + right) // 2`.
        *   Compare the middle element `arr[mid]` with the target value:
            *   If `arr[mid] == target`: Return `mid` (target found).
            *   If `arr[mid] < target`:  The target must be in the right half.  Set `left = mid + 1`.
            *   If `arr[mid] > target`: The target must be in the left half. Set `right = mid - 1`.

3.  **Not Found:**
    *   If the loop finishes without finding the target (i.e., `left > right`), the target is not present in the array.  Return -1 (or an appropriate indicator).

## Example

Suppose we have a sorted array: `arr = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]` and we want to find the target `8`.

1.  `left = 0`, `right = 5`, `mid = 2`.  `arr[2] = 7 < 8`.  `left = 3`.
2.  `left = 3`, `right = 5`, `mid = 4`.  `arr[4] = 11 > 8`.  `right = 3`.
3.  `left = 3`, `right = 3`, `mid = 3`.  `arr[3] = 8 == 8`.  Return `3`.

## Time Complexity

*   **Best Case:** O(1) (target is the middle element).
*   **Average Case:** O(log n) (the search space is halved in each step).
*   **Worst Case:** O(log n) (target is at the beginning or end, or not present).

## Space Complexity

*   O(1) (iterative implementation) - Binary search uses a constant amount of extra space.
*   O(log n) recursive.

## Advantages

*   **Very Efficient:**  O(log n) time complexity makes it extremely fast for searching large sorted datasets.
*   **Simple to Implement:** The algorithm is relatively straightforward to understand and implement.

## Disadvantages

*   **Requires Sorted Data:**  Binary search *only* works on sorted data. If the data is not sorted, it must be sorted first, which adds to the overall time complexity.
*   **Not Suitable for Linked Lists**: Since there is no index for linked lists.

## Use Cases

*   **Searching in Sorted Arrays:**  The primary use case is efficiently finding elements in sorted arrays.
*   **Finding the First/Last Occurrence:**  Can be modified to find the first or last occurrence of a target value in an array with duplicates.
*   **Root Finding:**  Used in numerical methods to approximate the roots of equations.
*   **Debugging:** Can help locate errors in sorted data or code.

# 278. First Bad Version, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach(es)

### Binary Search Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, `left = 1` and `right = n`, representing the range of versions to search.
2.  **Iteration:** While `left < right`:
    *   Calculate the middle version: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`. This avoids potential overflow issues.
    *   Call the `isBadVersion(mid)` API.
    *   If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `True`, the first bad version is in the range `[left, mid]`.  Set `right = mid`.
    *   If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `False`, the first bad version is in the range `[mid + 1, right]`. Set `left = mid + 1`.
3.  **Result:** When `left == right`, `left` will be the first bad version. Return `left`.

Data Structures:

*   None explicitly used, just integer variables for pointers.

Time Complexity:

*   O(log n) - Binary search reduces the search space by half in each step.

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

Trade-offs:

*   This is the most efficient approach for this problem, minimizing API calls.

### Linear Search Approach
Algorithm:
1. **Iteration:** start loop from 1 to n
2. **Check isBadVersion:** for current value
3. **Result:** If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `True` then return it, else continue the loop.

Data Structures:

* None

Time Complexity:

* O(n)

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

Trade-offs:

*  This approach is less efficient than binary search.

## Code

[Binary Search Approach](./solution.py)
[Linear Search Approach](./solution_linear.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The key to solving this problem efficiently is recognizing that the problem exhibits the properties of a binary search: a sorted input (versions are sequential) and a way to determine which half to discard (the `isBadVersion` API).
*   The `left + (right - left) // 2` calculation for `mid` is preferred over `(left + right) // 2` to avoid potential integer overflow when `left` and `right` are very large.

```

This completes the generation of the LeetCode solution repository.  It's well-structured, includes a detailed explanation of the binary search approach (and a less efficient linear approach for comparison), and adheres to all requirements. The topic file is also comprehensive and well-written.
