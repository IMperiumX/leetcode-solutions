# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

**Example 1:**

Input: `s = "babad"`
Output: `"bab"`
Explanation: `"aba"` is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

Input: `s = "cbbd"`
Output: `"bb"`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

## Approach(es)

### Expand Around Center Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Iterate through Centers:** Iterate through each character in the string `s`.  Each character, and the space *between* characters, can be the center of a palindrome.
2.  **Expand from Center:** For each center, expand outwards (left and right) as long as the characters at the left and right pointers are equal, and the pointers are within the bounds of the string.
3.  **Track Longest:** Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far.
4.  **Handle Odd and Even Lengths:**  Consider both odd-length palindromes (centered on a single character) and even-length palindromes (centered between two characters).

**Data Structures:**

*   String to store the longest palindrome found.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string.  We iterate through each character (or space between characters) as a potential center, and the expansion process can take up to O(n) time in the worst case.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) - Constant extra space. We only use a few variables to store pointers and the longest palindrome.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is relatively intuitive and easy to implement. It doesn't require extra space for a DP table.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **DP Table:** Create a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `n x n`, where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.
2.  **Base Cases:**
    *   All single characters are palindromes: `dp[i][i] = True` for all `i`.
    *   Two adjacent identical characters form a palindrome: `dp[i][i+1] = True` if `s[i] == s[i+1]`.
3.  **Iteration:** Iterate through substrings of increasing length, from length 3 up to `n`.
    *   For each substring `s[i:j+1]`, check if `s[i] == s[j]` and if the inner substring `s[i+1:j]` is a palindrome (`dp[i+1][j-1]`). If both conditions are true, then `dp[i][j] = True`.
4.  **Track Longest:** Keep track of the starting index (`start`) and maximum length (`max_len`) of the longest palindrome found.

**Data Structures:**

*   2D boolean array (`dp`) of size `n x n`.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string. We fill the `dp` table, which takes O(n^2) time.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n^2) -  The space used by the `dp` table.

**Trade-offs:**

*   The DP approach is more systematic but uses O(n^2) extra space for the `dp` table. The expand-around-center approach is generally preferred for its space efficiency.  The DP approach can be easier to reason about for some people.

# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters. They are a fundamental data type in most programming languages and are used to represent text.

**Key Properties:**

*   **Immutability (in many languages):** In languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.
*   **Mutability (in some languages):** In languages like C++, strings (using `std::string`) are mutable.
*   **Character Encoding:** Strings are stored as a sequence of bytes, and a character encoding (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16) is used to map those bytes to characters.  UTF-8 is the most common encoding for web pages and is widely supported.
* **Indexing and Slicing**: In python you can access an individual character or sub-string from a string.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
*   **Length:** Getting the number of characters in a string.
*   **Substring:** Extracting a portion of a string.
*   **Comparison:** Comparing two strings lexicographically.
*   **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a substring within a string.
*   **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
*   **Joining:** Combining a list of strings into a single string, using a separator.
*   **Case Conversion:**  Converting a string to uppercase or lowercase.
* **Striping:** Removing leading/trailing whitespaces.

# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Optimal Substructure:** A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2.  **Overlapping Subproblems:**  The problem can be broken down into subproblems that are reused multiple times.  This is where DP differs from divide-and-conquer, where subproblems are typically independent.
3.  **Memoization (Top-Down):**  Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them for the same inputs later. This is often implemented using recursion.
4.  **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** Build up solutions to larger subproblems iteratively, starting from the smallest subproblems and using their solutions to solve larger ones. This is often implemented using iterative loops and a table (e.g., an array).

**Steps to Solve a DP Problem:**

1.  **Identify the Subproblems:** Define the subproblems in terms of smaller instances of the original problem.
2.  **Define the Recurrence Relation:** Express the solution to a subproblem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems. This is the core of the DP approach.
3.  **Determine the Base Cases:**  Identify the smallest subproblems that can be solved directly without further recursion or iteration.
4.  **Choose Memoization or Tabulation:** Decide whether to use a top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approach.
5.  **Implement the Solution:**  Write the code to solve the problem, either recursively with memoization or iteratively with tabulation.
6. **Analyze Time and space Complexity**

**Example: Fibonacci Numbers**

*   **Subproblem:** `fib(n)`: The nth Fibonacci number.
*   **Recurrence Relation:** `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`
*   **Base Cases:** `fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`
