# Sliding Window

The Sliding Window technique is a common and efficient approach for solving problems that involve finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions. It's particularly useful when dealing with arrays or strings and looking for contiguous sequences.

## Key Concepts

*   **Window:** A contiguous portion (subarray or substring) of the input data.
*   **Sliding:** The window "slides" across the input data, typically one element at a time.
*   **Dynamic Window Size:** The size of the window can be fixed or variable, depending on the problem requirements.
*   **Constraints/Conditions:**  The problem usually specifies conditions that the window must satisfy (e.g., containing unique characters, summing to a target value, etc.).

## How Sliding Window Works

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, typically `left` and `right`, which define the boundaries of the window.  Often, both pointers start at the beginning of the input data.
2.  **Expansion:**  Move the `right` pointer to expand the window, adding elements to the window until the window satisfies the problem's constraints.
3.  **Contraction (if necessary):** If the window violates the constraints, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the constraints are met again.
4.  **Update Result:**  As the window slides, update the desired result (e.g., maximum length, minimum sum, etc.) based on the current window.
5.  **Termination:**  Continue sliding the window until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the input data.

## Common Variations

*   **Fixed-Size Window:** The size of the window is constant throughout the process.
*   **Variable-Size Window:** The size of the window changes dynamically as the window slides.
*   **Two Pointers:** The core of the sliding window technique involves using two pointers to manage the window boundaries.

## Advantages of Sliding Window

*   **Efficiency:** Can often reduce time complexity from O(n^2) or O(n^3) (brute-force approaches) to O(n).
*   **Space Efficiency:** Often requires only constant extra space (O(1)), especially for fixed-size windows.

## When to Consider Sliding Window

*   The problem involves finding subarrays or substrings.
*   The problem specifies constraints or conditions on contiguous sequences.
*   The problem asks for the "longest," "shortest," "maximum," or "minimum" of something related to subarrays/substrings.

# Queues

Queues are a fundamental linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.  The first element added to the queue is the first element removed.  Think of a queue of people waiting in line â€“ the person who arrived first is the first person served.

## Key Concepts

*   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** The element that has been in the queue the longest is the first one to be removed.
*   **Enqueue (or Push):**  Adding an element to the rear (back) of the queue.
*   **Dequeue (or Pop):** Removing the element from the front of the queue.
*   **Front (or Peek):** Retrieving the value of the front element without removing it.
*   **Rear:**  The end of the queue where elements are added.
*   **isEmpty:** Checking if the queue is empty.
*   **isFull:** Checking if the queue is full (relevant for array-based implementations with fixed size).

## Common Queue Operations

*   **enqueue(element):** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
*   **dequeue():** Removes and returns the front element of the queue. Raises an error if the queue is empty.
*   **peek():** Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.  Raises an error if the queue is empty.
*   **empty():** Returns `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.
*   **size():** Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Implementations

*   **Array-based:** Queues can be implemented using arrays.  A circular array is often used to avoid shifting elements when dequeueing.
*   **Linked List-based:** Queues can be implemented using linked lists.  This allows for dynamic resizing.
* **Using two Stacks**: Queue can be implemented using two stacks.

## Common Queue Applications

*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traversing graphs and trees level by level.
*   **Task Scheduling:**  Managing tasks in an operating system.
*   **Print Queues:**  Handling print jobs in a printer.
*   **Data Buffers:**  Storing data temporarily before it is processed.
* **Asynchronous Programming**

# Monotonic Queue

A monotonic queue is a data structure that maintains a specific order (either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing) among its elements, similar to a monotonic stack. However, unlike a stack (LIFO), a monotonic queue allows efficient access to both the front and back, like a regular queue (FIFO). It's often implemented using a double-ended queue (deque) to support efficient additions and removals from both ends.

## Key Concepts

*   **Monotonicity:** The defining property is the ordered nature of the elements.
*   **Increasing/Decreasing:**
    *   **Monotonically Increasing Queue:** Elements are in increasing (or non-decreasing) order from front to back.
    *   **Monotonically Decreasing Queue:** Elements are in decreasing (or non-increasing) order from front to back.
*   **Double-Ended Queue (Deque):**  A deque is typically used to implement a monotonic queue, as it allows efficient additions and removals from both ends (O(1) time complexity).

## How Monotonic Queues Work (Example: Monotonically Decreasing)

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an empty deque.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the input sequence.
3.  **Maintenance:** For each element:
    *   **Remove Smaller Elements (from the back):** While the deque is not empty and the current element is *greater than or equal to* the element at the back of the deque, remove elements from the back of the deque. This ensures the decreasing order.
    *   **Append Current Element:** Append the current element (or its index, depending on the problem) to the back of the deque.
    *   **Remove Outdated Elements (from the front):** If the element at the front of the deque is outside the current window or no longer relevant, remove it from the front.  This step is crucial for sliding window problems.
4. **Access Max/Min**: The element at the *front* of the deque is always the maximum (for a decreasing queue) or minimum (for an increasing queue) within the relevant range.

## Applications of Monotonic Queues

*   **Sliding Window Maximum/Minimum:** Finding the maximum or minimum element in each sliding window of a fixed size (LeetCode 239).
*   **Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K:** (LeetCode 862)
* **Other Optimization Problems**: Problems where you need to maintain a sorted order of elements within a dynamic window or range.

## Advantages

*   **Efficiency:** Can solve problems in linear time (O(n)) that might otherwise require O(n*k) or more.
*   **Maintain Order:** The ordered nature helps in problems where relative element order is important within a window.

# 239. Sliding Window Maximum, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return *the max sliding window*.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation:
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= nums.length

## Approach(es)

### Deque Approach (Monotonic Queue)

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize an empty deque `dq` (double-ended queue).  This deque will store *indices* of elements in `nums`, not the elements themselves.  The deque will maintain a decreasing order of elements from front to back (the front will always have the index of the maximum element within the current window).
2.  Initialize an empty list `result` to store the maximums.
3.  Iterate through the `nums` array (index `i`):
    *   **Remove Outdated Elements:**  While the deque is not empty and the index at the front of the deque (`dq[0]`) is outside the current window (i.e., `dq[0] <= i - k`), remove the element from the front of the deque (using `popleft()`).
    *   **Maintain Decreasing Order:** While the deque is not empty and the element at the back of the deque (`nums[dq[-1]]`) is less than the current element (`nums[i]`), remove elements from the back of the deque (using `pop()`). This ensures that the deque always stores indices in decreasing order of their corresponding values in `nums`.
    *   **Append Current Index:** Append the current index `i` to the back of the deque.
    *   **Add Maximum to Result:** If the current index `i` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` (meaning the window is full), append the element at the front of the deque (`nums[dq[0]]`) to the `result` list. This is the maximum element in the current window.
4.  Return the `result` list.

Data Structures:

*   Deque (`collections.deque` in Python).

Time Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. Each element is added to and removed from the deque at most once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(k), where k is the window size.  The deque will hold at most `k` elements (indices).

Trade-offs:

*   The deque approach (monotonic queue) provides an efficient O(n) solution. It's the preferred method for this problem.  The key is to understand how the deque maintains the indices of potential maximum elements in decreasing order.

## Code

[Deque Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes

This problem is a classic example of using a monotonic queue (implemented with a deque) to efficiently track the maximum (or minimum) element within a sliding window.  Understanding how the deque maintains the decreasing order of potential maximums is crucial.  The deque stores *indices*, not values, which allows us to efficiently remove elements that are no longer within the current window. A brute-force solution that checks all elements in each window would have a time complexity of O(n*k), which would be too slow for the given constraints.
