**Step 4: `README.md` Generation**

# 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1), Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Implement the `RandomizedSet` class:

*   `RandomizedSet()` Initializes the `RandomizedSet` object.
*   `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
*   `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise.
*   `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the *same probability* of being returned.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in **average O(1)** time complexity.

**Example 1:**

Input
["RandomizedSet", "insert", "remove", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "insert", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]

Explanation
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   -2<sup>31</sup> <= val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
*   At most 2 * 10<sup>5</sup> calls will be made to `insert`, `remove`, and `getRandom`.
*   There will be at least one element in the data structure when `getRandom` is called.

## Approach(es)

### Hash Map and List Approach

Algorithm:

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `num_map`: A dictionary (hash map) that stores the mapping of values to their indices in the `nums` list.
    *   `nums`: A list that stores the actual values.
2.  **`insert(val)`:**
    *   Check if `val` is already in `num_map`. If it is, return `False`.
    *   If not, add `val` to the end of the `nums` list.
    *   Store the index of `val` (which is `len(nums) - 1`) in `num_map`.
    *   Return `True`.
3.  **`remove(val)`:**
    *   Check if `val` is in `num_map`. If it's not, return `False`.
    *   Get the index of `val` from `num_map`.
    *   Get the last element in the `nums` list.
    *   **Swap:**  Overwrite the element at `index` in `nums` with the `last_element`.
    *   Update the index of `last_element` in `num_map` to `index`.
    *   Remove the last element from `nums` (using `pop()`, which is O(1)).
    *   Remove `val` from `num_map`.
    *   Return `True`.
4.  **`getRandom()`:**
    *   Use the `random.choice()` function in Python to select a random element from the `nums` list.

Data Structures:

*   Dictionary (`num_map`): For O(1) average time complexity for checking existence and getting indices.
*   List (`nums`): For O(1) time complexity for appending and accessing elements by index (and for `random.choice()`).

Time Complexity:

*   `insert(val)`: O(1) on average.
*   `remove(val)`: O(1) on average.
*   `getRandom()`: O(1).

Space Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set.  Both the dictionary and the list can store up to n elements.

Trade-offs:
- The key to achieving O(1) average time complexity for removal is the swapping trick. We swap the element to be removed with the last element and then remove the last element. This avoids shifting elements, which would take O(n) time.
-  Using both a hash map and a list provides the benefits of both: fast lookups (hash map) and random access (list).

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Explanation**

*   **Hash Table (Dictionary):**  Used for efficient lookups and index management.
*   **Array (List):** Used for storing the elements and enabling random access.
*  **Design:** This problem asks to design class.

# Hash Table

## Explanation

A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a *hash function* to compute an *index*, also called a *hash code*, into an array of *buckets* or *slots*, from which the desired value can be found.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause *hash collisions* where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Hash Function:** A function that takes a key as input and returns an integer hash code, which is used as an index into the array of buckets.
*   **Bucket:** A slot in the array where key-value pairs are stored.
*   **Collision:** When two different keys hash to the same bucket.
*   **Collision Resolution:** Techniques for handling collisions, such as:
    *   **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to that bucket.
    *   **Open Addressing:** If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for the next available slot in the array.  Common probing methods include:
        *   **Linear Probing:**  Check consecutive slots.
        *   **Quadratic Probing:**  Check slots with increasing quadratic offsets.
        *   **Double Hashing:** Use a second hash function to determine the probing interval.

**Advantages:**

*   **Fast Average-Case Performance:**  Hash tables offer O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
*   **Efficient Key-Value Storage:** Well-suited for storing and retrieving data based on unique keys.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Worst-Case Performance:** In the worst case (e.g., all keys hash to the same bucket), operations can degrade to O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of keys.
*   **Unordered Data:** Hash tables do not maintain any specific order of the keys.
*   **Hash Function Dependence:** The performance of a hash table heavily relies on the quality of the hash function.  A poor hash function can lead to frequent collisions and poor performance.
* **Space Overhead:** can be significant.

**Common Applications:**

*   **Dictionaries/Maps:**  Implementing dictionaries or maps in programming languages.
*   **Caching:**  Storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
*   **Symbol Tables:**  Used by compilers and interpreters to store information about variables, functions, etc.
*   **Database Indexing:**  Speeding up database queries.
*   **Sets:**  Implementing sets (collections of unique elements).
*   **Counting Distinct Elements:**  Counting the number of unique elements in a stream of data.

**Python's `dict`:**

Python's built-in `dict` type is a highly optimized implementation of a hash table. It uses a combination of techniques, including open addressing with a sophisticated probing strategy, to achieve excellent performance.

# Array Manipulation

## Explanation

Array manipulation encompasses a wide range of operations performed on arrays (or lists in Python) to modify their contents, structure, or extract information from them. Arrays are fundamental data structures, and proficiency in array manipulation is essential for many programming tasks.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Accessing Elements:** Retrieving elements at specific indices.
*   **Updating Elements:** Modifying the value of elements at specific indices.
*   **Insertion:** Adding new elements at the beginning, end, or a specific position within the array.
*   **Deletion:** Removing elements from the array.
*   **Searching:** Finding the index of a specific element.
*   **Sorting:** Arranging elements in a specific order (ascending, descending).
*   **Reversing:** Reversing the order of elements.
*   **Slicing:** Extracting a sub-array.
*   **Concatenation:** Combining two or more arrays.
*   **Iteration:** Looping through the elements of the array.
*   **Transformation:** Applying a function to each element (e.g., mapping, filtering).
*   **Reshaping:** Changing the dimensions of a multi-dimensional array.
*   **Transposing:** Swapping rows and columns in a 2D array (matrix).

# Design

## Explanation
"Design" problems in coding interviews typically involve creating a class or a set of classes that meet specific requirements and constraints. These problems assess a candidate's ability to think abstractly, model real-world scenarios into code, and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles effectively.  They are less about finding a single "correct" algorithm and more about demonstrating good software design practices.

**Key Aspects of Design Problems:**

*   **Requirements Gathering:** Understanding the problem statement and clarifying any ambiguities. Asking clarifying questions is crucial.
*   **Abstraction:**  Identifying the core entities and their relationships.
*   **Encapsulation:**  Hiding internal implementation details and exposing only necessary interfaces.
*   **Modularity:**  Breaking down the problem into smaller, reusable components.
*   **Extensibility:**  Designing the system so that it can be easily extended with new features or modified to meet changing requirements.
*   **Scalability:** Considering how the system would perform with a large number of users or data.
*   **Efficiency:**  Choosing appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handling potential errors and edge cases gracefully.
*   **Testability:**  Designing the system so that it can be easily tested.
*   **Trade-offs:** Understanding the trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., memory usage vs. performance, complexity vs. flexibility).

**Common Design Problem Patterns:**

*   **Design a Data Structure:** Implement a data structure with specific operations and constraints (e.g., LRU Cache, Design Hit Counter, Design a Stack with Min Function).
*   **Design a System:** Model a real-world system, such as a parking lot, a vending machine, or a social media feed.
*   **API Design:** Design an API for a specific service, considering request/response formats, error handling, and authentication.

**Example Problem**
* [362. Design Hit Counter](./0362-design-hit-counter/README.md)
* [380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](./0380-insert-delete-getrandom-o1/README.md)
