```python

    #                   all stations. If total_tank is negative at the end,
    #                   it means no solution is possible.
    #    - curr_tank:   Keeps track of the current gas surplus/deficit as we

        # at the current station.
        total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]

        # 3. Check if we can reach the next station:
        #    If curr_tank becomes negative, it means we cannot reach the next
        #    station (i+1) from our current starting_station.  Therefore:
        #    - We update starting_station to i + 1, effectively discarding
        #      all previous stations as potential starting points.
        #    - We reset curr_tank to 0, as we're starting fresh from the new
        #      potential starting station.
        if curr_tank < 0:
            starting_station = i + 1
            curr_tank = 0

    # 4. Determine if a solution exists:
    #    After iterating through all stations, if total_tank is non-negative,
    #    it means a solution exists, and starting_station is the correct
    #    starting point.  Otherwise, no solution is possible.
    return starting_station if total_tank >= 0 else -1

# 134. Gas Station, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i`th station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i`th station to its next (`i + 1`)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the *starting gas station's index* if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is *guaranteed to be unique*.

**Example 1:**

Input: `gas = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `cost = [3,4,5,1,2]`
Output: `3`

**Example 2:**

Input: `gas = [2,3,4]`, `cost = [3,4,3]`
Output: `-1`

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4`

## Approach(es)

### Greedy Approach

The key insight is that if the total sum of `gas[i] - cost[i]` for all stations is negative, then there is no solution.  If the total sum is non-negative, then a solution *must* exist.  Furthermore, we can find the starting station in a single pass.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `total_tank = 0`: Keeps track of the total gas surplus/deficit.
    *   `curr_tank = 0`:  Keeps track of the current gas level starting from a potential starting station.
    *   `starting_station = 0`:  The potential starting station index.

2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through the gas stations (from `i = 0` to `n - 1`):
    *   Update `total_tank` and `curr_tank`: `total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]`, `curr_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]`.
    *   **Check for Negative `curr_tank`:** If `curr_tank` becomes negative, it means we cannot reach the next station (`i + 1`) from the current `starting_station`.
        *   Update `starting_station = i + 1`.
        *   Reset `curr_tank = 0`.

3.  **Return Result:** After the loop, if `total_tank >= 0`, return `starting_station`. Otherwise, return `-1`.

**Data Structures:**

*   No extra data structures are needed beyond a few integer variables.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of gas stations. We iterate through the arrays once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant extra space.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is very efficient (O(n) time and O(1) space).
*   The core logic relies on understanding *why* this greedy approach works.  The proof is non-trivial (see Notes).

[Greedy Approach](./solution_detailed.py)

## Notes

*   **Proof of Correctness (Why the Greedy Approach Works):**
    *   **If `sum(gas) < sum(cost)`, no solution exists:** This is obvious; if the total gas available is less than the total cost, we cannot complete the circuit.
    *   **If `sum(gas) >= sum(cost)`, a solution *always* exists:** This is the crucial part. Let's consider the cumulative sum `S[i] = gas[0] - cost[0] + gas[1] - cost[1] + ... + gas[i] - cost[i]`.  Since `sum(gas) >= sum(cost)`, `S[n-1] >= 0`.
        *   If all `S[i]` are non-negative, then station 0 is a valid starting point.
        *   If some `S[i]` are negative, let `k` be the index where `S[k]` is the *minimum*.  Then, starting from station `k + 1` (wrapping around to 0 if `k + 1 == n`) will guarantee that we can complete the circuit.  This is because by shifting the starting point, we are essentially adding `-S[k]` to all the cumulative sums, making them all non-negative.
    *   **Uniqueness:** The problem statement guarantees uniqueness.  This is because if there were two valid starting points, we could combine the paths to create a cycle with a positive net gas gain, which is impossible in a valid solution.

* This solution is highly efficient and avoids unnecessary nested loops or complex data structures. The greedy approach directly identifies the potential starting point by tracking the current and total gas levels.

The solution and README are complete.  Since it uses a Greedy approach we can reuse `Greedy.md` file from previous task. All files have been generated and are well structured.
