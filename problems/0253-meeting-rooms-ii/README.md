## Problem Description

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of conference rooms required*.

**Example 1:**

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2

**Example 2:**

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= starti < endi <= 10^6`

## Approach(es)

### Chronological Ordering (Sorting)

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Separate Start and End Times:** Create two separate lists: one for start times and one for end times.
2.  **Sort:** Sort both the start times and end times lists.
3.  **Iterate:** Iterate through the sorted start times.
    *   If the current start time is *before* the earliest available end time (pointed to by `end_pointer`), we need a new room (`rooms += 1`).
    *   Otherwise, we can reuse a room, so we increment the `end_pointer` to the next available end time.
4.  **Return:** Return the final `rooms` count.

**Data Structures:**

*   Two lists: `starts` and `ends`.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N log N), where N is the number of intervals.  The dominant cost is sorting the start and end times.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(N) - We create two lists of size N.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is conceptually clear. It simulates allocating rooms as meetings start and end.
*   The sorting step is the bottleneck.

### Min-Heap Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Sort by Start Time:** Sort the input `intervals` list by start time.
2.  **Min-Heap:** Use a min-heap (`free_rooms`) to store the *end times* of currently ongoing meetings.  The root of the heap will always be the earliest ending meeting.
3.  **Iterate:** Iterate through the sorted intervals:
    *   If the current meeting's start time is greater than or equal to the earliest end time in the heap (meaning a room is available), remove the earliest end time from the heap (using `heapq.heappop()`).
    *   Add the current meeting's end time to the heap (using `heapq.heappush()`).
4.  **Return:** The final size of the heap represents the minimum number of rooms required.

**Data Structures:**

*   Min-Heap (`free_rooms`): Stores end times of meetings.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N log N), where N is the number of intervals.  Sorting takes O(N log N), and heap operations (push and pop) take O(log N) each, but we do at most 2N heap operations.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(N) -  In the worst case, the heap might contain all the end times (if all meetings overlap).

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is generally very efficient. The min-heap allows us to quickly find the earliest ending meeting.
*   It might be slightly less intuitive than the chronological ordering approach.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*   **Array:**  The input is an array of intervals.
*   **Sorting:** Both solutions involve sorting.
*   **Heap (Priority Queue):** One solution uses a min-heap.
*   **Greedy:** Both solutions have a greedy nature, making the locally optimal choice at each step.

# Greedy

A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.  In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the best choice it can at each step, without considering the future consequences.

**Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms:**

*   **Greedy Choice Property:**  A globally optimal solution can be obtained by making a locally optimal (greedy) choice.
*   **Optimal Substructure:**  An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.

**Advantages:**

*   **Simplicity:**  Greedy algorithms are often simple to design and implement.
*   **Efficiency:**  Greedy algorithms can be very efficient, often with linear or near-linear time complexity.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Not Always Optimal:**  Greedy algorithms don't always guarantee a globally optimal solution.  It's crucial to prove that the greedy choice property holds for the problem.

**Examples of Greedy Algorithms:**

*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**  Finding the shortest path in a graph.
*   **Prim's Algorithm:** Finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph.
*   **Kruskal's Algorithm:**  Finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph.
*   **Huffman Coding:**  Data compression.
* **Activity Selection/Meeting Rooms**
