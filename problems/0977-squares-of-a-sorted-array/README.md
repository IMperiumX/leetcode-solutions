# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array, Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in *non-decreasing* order, return *an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order*.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

## Approach(es)

### Sorting Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Square each number in the `nums` array.  This can be done using a list comprehension: `[x * x for x in nums]`.
2.  Sort the resulting array of squares using the built-in `sorted()` function.
3.  Return the sorted array.

Data Structures:

*   List

Time Complexity:

*   O(n log n) - Dominated by the sorting step. Squaring each element takes O(n) time, but sorting takes O(n log n).

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) -  Python's `sorted()` function creates a new sorted list.  (If we used `nums.sort()` *after* squaring the elements in place, the space complexity could be considered O(1) or O(log n) depending on the specific sorting algorithm used internally, TimSort in general).  However, we create a new list in the first step for squaring.

Trade-offs:

* Simple to implement but not the most efficient (due to sorting).

### Two Pointers Approach

Algorithm:

1.  Initialize `left = 0` and `right = n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`).  These pointers point to the beginning and end of the `nums` array, respectively.
2.  Create a new array `result` of size `n` to store the squared and sorted values.
3.  Iterate from `i = n - 1` down to 0 (filling the `result` array from the end):
    *   Compare the absolute values of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]`.
    *   If `abs(nums[left]) > abs(nums[right])`, the square of `nums[left]` will be larger.  Place `nums[left] * nums[left]` at `result[i]` and increment `left`.
    *   Otherwise, the square of `nums[right]` will be larger (or equal). Place `nums[right] * nums[right]` at `result[i]` and decrement `right`.
4.  Return the `result` array.

Data Structures:

*   List

Time Complexity:

*   O(n) - We iterate through the array once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n) - We create a new `result` array of size `n`.  This is considered O(n) even though it is required for output.

Trade-offs:

* More efficient in time (O(n)) than the sorting approach. Requires careful handling of pointers.

[Sorting Approach](./solution_sort.py)
[Two Pointers Approach](./solution_two_pointers.py)

## Notes

*   The two-pointer approach is the optimal solution, achieving O(n) time complexity as requested in the follow-up.
*   The key idea behind the two-pointer approach is that the largest squared value will always come from either the leftmost or rightmost element in the original sorted array (because squaring makes negative numbers positive, and the array is sorted).
*   This problem demonstrates the power of the two-pointer technique for optimizing solutions involving sorted arrays.

```

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

*Prompt:* Topic extraction.
*Analysis*: The relevant topics are "Arrays", "Sorting", and "Two Pointers".

*   `Arrays.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Sorting.md` (already exists, reuse)
*   `Two Pointers.md` (already exists, reuse)

This completes the solution repository, providing both sorting and two-pointer solutions, a comprehensive README, and links to the relevant topic files. It correctly addresses the follow-up question and provides an O(n) solution.
