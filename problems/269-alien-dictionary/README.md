# Topological Sort

Topological sorting is an algorithm for ordering the nodes of a *directed acyclic graph* (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering.  In other words, it's a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering.  If the graph contains cycles, a topological sort is not possible.

## Applications of Topological Sort

*   **Dependency Resolution:**  Determining the order in which to install software packages, where some packages depend on others.
*   **Build Systems (Makefiles):**  Determining the order in which to compile files, where some files depend on others.
*   **Course Scheduling:**  Finding a valid order to take courses, given prerequisites.
*   **Task Scheduling:**  Scheduling tasks where some tasks must be completed before others can start.
*   **Data Serialization:** Determining the order in which to serialize objects with dependencies.

## Algorithms for Topological Sort

There are two main algorithms for topological sorting:

1.  **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based):**

    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Compute the *in-degree* of each node (the number of incoming edges).
        *   Create a queue and add all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to the queue.
    *   **Iteration:**
        *   While the queue is not empty:
            *   Remove a node `u` from the queue.
            *   Add `u` to the topological ordering.
            *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` (i.e., for each edge (u, v)):
                *   Decrement the in-degree of `v`.
                *   If the in-degree of `v` becomes 0, add `v` to the queue.
    *   **Cycle Detection:** If the number of nodes in the topological ordering is less than the total number of nodes in the graph, the graph contains a cycle.

2.  **DFS-based Algorithm:**

    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Create a stack to store the topological ordering.
        *   Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.
        * Create a set to keep track of nodes in current recursion stack.
    *   **Iteration:**
        *   For each node `u` in the graph:
            *   If `u` has not been visited, call a recursive helper function `dfs(u)`.
    *   **`dfs(u)` function:**
        * If u is in recursion stack, then it is a cycle.
        *   Mark `u` as visited and add it to the recursion stack.
        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:
            *   If `v` has not been visited, call `dfs(v)`.
        *   Push `u` onto the stack and remove from recursion stack.
    *   **Result:** The topological ordering is the reverse of the order in which nodes are popped from the stack.

## Time and Space Complexity (Kahn's Algorithm)

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.  Each node and each edge is processed at most once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(V + E) in the worst case.  The queue and the in-degree map can store up to V elements, and the adjacency list can store up to E elements.

## Time and Space Complexity (DFS Algorithm)

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.  Each node and each edge is visited at most once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(V)

## Example (Kahn's Algorithm)

Consider the following DAG:

```
A -> B -> C
^    |
|    v
D -> E
```

1.  **In-degrees:** A(1), B(2), C(1), D(0), E(2)
2.  **Queue:** [D]
3.  **Result:** []

*   Dequeue D. Result: [D]
    *   Decrement in-degree of A: A(0)
    *   Decrement in-degree of E: E(1)
    *   Add A to queue: Queue: [A]
*   Dequeue A. Result: [D, A]
    *   Decrement in-degree of B: B(1)
    * Add nothing to queue.
*   Dequeue B. Result: [D, A, B]
      *   Decrement in-degree of C: C(0)
    *   Decrement in-degree of E: E(0)
    *   Add C to queue: Queue: [C]
    *   Add E to queue: Queue: [C,E]
*  Dequeue C. Result: [D, A, B, C]
    * Add nothing
*  Dequeue E. Result: [D, A, B, C, E]

Final topological ordering: D, A, B, C, E

# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level.  It starts at a designated source node and visits all its immediate neighbors (nodes directly connected to it). Then, for each of those neighbors, it visits their unvisited neighbors, and so on.  This process continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.

## How BFS Works

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out) to store nodes to be visited.
    *   Mark the source node as visited and enqueue it.
    *   Create a data structure (e.g., a set or an array) to keep track of visited nodes.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
        *   Process the dequeued node (e.g., print its value, perform some operation).
        *   For each of the node's unvisited neighbors:
            *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
            *   Enqueue the neighbor.

## Key Concepts

*   **Queue:** BFS uses a queue to maintain the order of nodes to visit.  Nodes are visited in the order they are enqueued.
*   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph in layers.  It visits all nodes at depth 1 before visiting any nodes at depth 2, and so on.
*   **Visited Set:**  A data structure (often a set or an array) is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant visits.

## Example

Consider a graph represented by an adjacency list:

```
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

Starting from node 'A', BFS would visit the nodes in the following order: A, B, C, D, E, F.

## Time Complexity

*   **O(V + E)**, where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  Each node and each edge is visited at most once.

## Space Complexity

*   **O(V)** in the worst case, where V is the number of vertices. This happens when the graph is a complete graph or a very dense graph, and the queue might need to store all vertices at some point.  In practice, the space complexity can be less, depending on the graph's structure.

## Advantages of BFS

*   **Finds Shortest Path (in unweighted graphs):** BFS guarantees finding the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) from the source node to any other reachable node in an unweighted graph.
*   **Completeness:**  BFS is complete, meaning it will find a path to a target node if one exists.
*   **Simple to Implement:** The algorithm is relatively straightforward to implement using a queue.

## Disadvantages of BFS

*   **Memory Usage:** Can use a significant amount of memory, especially for large graphs.

## Use Cases

*   **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
*   **Web Crawling:**  Crawling web pages, starting from a seed URL and visiting links.
*   **Social Networks:**  Finding connections between people.
*   **Network Broadcasting:**  Sending a message to all nodes in a network.
*   **Garbage Collection:**  Identifying reachable objects in memory.
* **Level order traversal in trees**

# 269. Alien Dictionary, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings `words` from the alien language's dictionary. Now it is claimed that the strings in words are **sorted lexicographically** by the rules of this new language.

Return *a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in lexicographically increasing order* by the new language's rules. If there is no solution, return `""`. If there are multiple solutions, return *any of them*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["z","x"]
Output: "zx"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["z","x","z"]
Output: ""
Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
```
**Example 4:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","ab"]
Output: ""
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
*   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Approach(es)

### Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm - BFS)

Algorithm:

1.  **Build the Graph and In-Degree Count:**
    *   Create an adjacency list (`adj`) to represent the directed graph, where `adj[char]` is a set of characters that come *after* `char` in the alien alphabet.
    *   Create a dictionary (`in_degree`) to store the in-degree of each character (the number of incoming edges). Initialize the in-degree of all characters present in `words` to 0.
    *   Iterate through pairs of adjacent words in `words`:
        *   Compare the words character by character until a difference is found.
        *   If a difference is found at index `j` (`word1[j] != word2[j]`), add an edge from `word1[j]` to `word2[j]` in the adjacency list (if it doesn't already exist) and increment the in-degree of `word2[j]`.
        *   Break the inner loop after finding the first difference, as only the first difference between two words determines the order of characters.
        *   If no difference found check for edge cases like `["abc","ab"]` then there is no valid order, return "".

2.  **Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm):**
    *   Create a queue and add all characters with an in-degree of 0 to the queue. These are the characters that can come first in the alien alphabet.
    *   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the topological ordering.
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a character `char` from the queue.
        *   Append `char` to `result`.
        *   For each neighbor of `char` (characters that come after `char`):
            *   Decrement the in-degree of the neighbor.
            *   If the neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

3.  **Cycle Detection:**
    *   After the topological sort, if the length of `result` is not equal to the number of unique characters (the length of `in_degree`), it means there was a cycle in the graph, and no valid topological ordering exists. Return an empty string in this case.

4.  **Return Result:**
    *   If no cycle was detected, join the characters in `result` to form the alien alphabet string and return it.

Data Structures:

*   `defaultdict(set)` (from `collections`): Used for the adjacency list (`adj`).  Using a `set` ensures that we don't have duplicate edges.
*   `dict`: Used to store the in-degree of each character (`in_degree`).
*   `deque` (from `collections`): Used as a queue for Kahn's algorithm.
*   `list`:  Used to store the topological ordering (`result`).

Time Complexity:

*   O(C), where C is the total number of characters in all words. Building the graph and calculating in-degrees takes O(C) time.  Topological sort takes O(V + E) time, where V is the number of unique characters (at most 26) and E is the number of edges in the graph. Since V is bounded and E is proportional to the number of comparisons between characters in adjacent words, the overall complexity is dominated by the initial graph construction, which is O(C).  In the worst-case where we compare all letters from all words, it becomes O(C).

Space Complexity:

*   O(1) or O(V + E).  The adjacency list (`adj`) and in-degree map (`in_degree`) store information about the unique characters (V <= 26) and their relationships (E).  The queue used in topological sort can also store up to V elements.  Since the alphabet size is fixed (26), the space complexity can be considered O(1). If we were dealing with an unbounded character set then it would be O(V + E).

Trade-offs:

*   This is an efficient and standard approach for solving problems that can be modeled as topological sorting. It's relatively easy to understand and implement.

## Code

[Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm - BFS)](./solution.py)

## Notes

*   The problem can be visualized as constructing a directed graph where an edge from character 'a' to character 'b' indicates that 'a' comes before 'b' in the alien alphabet.
*   The core idea is that the order of characters is determined by the *first* difference between adjacent words in the sorted list.
*   Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based topological sort) is a good choice because it's intuitive and efficiently handles the cycle detection requirement.
* The edge case where the input `words` contains invalid order like `["abc", "ab"]` is important to consider.
