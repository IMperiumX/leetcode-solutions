**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1:** The problem description clearly identifies "Palindrome Pairs," LeetCode problem 336.
*   **Output:** "Problem Number: 336, Problem Name: Palindrome Pairs, Difficulty: Hard"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `336-palindrome-pairs`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2 (No solution provided):** We need to generate a solution. The brute-force approach (checking all pairs) would be O(n^2 * k), where n is the number of words and k is the average word length. This exceeds the required O(sum of words[i].length) complexity.  We'll use a hash map (dictionary) to store words and their indices, combined with efficient palindrome checking and careful consideration of prefixes and suffixes. This allows us to achieve the required time complexity.

# Hash Table

A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary, which is a collection of key-value pairs. It allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of elements based on their unique keys.  Hash tables use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## How it Works

1.  **Hash Function:**  A hash function takes a key as input and returns an integer, called a hash code.  A good hash function should:
    *   Be deterministic (same key always produces the same hash code).
    *   Distribute keys uniformly across the hash table's buckets to minimize collisions.
    *   Be computationally efficient.

2.  **Buckets:** The hash table is typically implemented as an array of buckets.  Each bucket can store one or more key-value pairs.

3.  **Collision Handling:**  When two different keys produce the same hash code (a collision), the hash table needs a mechanism to handle it.  Common methods include:
    *   **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a linked list (or other data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to that bucket.
    *   **Open Addressing:**  If a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for the next available slot in the array, using techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing.

## Operations

*   **Insertion:**
    1.  Compute the hash code of the key.
    2.  Use the hash code to determine the bucket index.
    3.  Insert the key-value pair into the bucket (handling collisions as needed).

*   **Retrieval (Lookup):**
    1.  Compute the hash code of the key.
    2.  Use the hash code to determine the bucket index.
    3.  Search the bucket for the key (handling collisions as needed). If found, return the associated value.

*   **Deletion:**
    1.  Compute the hash code of the key.
    2.  Use the hash code to determine the bucket index.
    3.  Search the bucket for the key (handling collisions as needed). If found, remove the key-value pair.

## Time Complexity

*   **Average Case:** O(1) for insertion, retrieval, and deletion, assuming a good hash function and collision handling strategy.
*   **Worst Case:** O(n), where n is the number of elements, if all keys hash to the same bucket (e.g., with a very poor hash function).  In practice, with a good hash function, this is very rare.

## Space Complexity

O(n), where n is the number of elements stored in the hash table. The space used depends on the number of buckets and the collision handling method.

## Advantages

*   **Fast Lookups:**  Hash tables provide very fast average-case performance for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
*   **Efficient for Key-Value Data:**  Ideal for storing and retrieving data based on unique keys.

## Disadvantages

*   **Worst-Case Performance:**  Can degrade to O(n) in the worst case (though this is uncommon with good hash functions).
*   **Unordered:** Hash tables do not maintain the order of elements.
*   **Hash Function Dependence:** Performance heavily relies on the quality of the hash function.

## Use Cases

*   **Dictionaries and Associative Arrays:**  Implementing dictionaries or maps in programming languages.
*   **Caching:**  Storing recently accessed data for quick retrieval.
*   **Symbol Tables:**  Used in compilers and interpreters to store information about identifiers.
*   **Database Indexing:**  Speeding up database queries.
*   **Sets:** Implementing sets (collections of unique elements).

# 336. Palindrome Pairs, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of unique strings `words`.

A **palindrome pair** is a pair of integers `(i, j)` such that:

*   `0 <= i, j < words.length`,
*   `i != j`, and
*   `words[i] + words[j]` (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.

Return *an array of all the **palindrome pairs** of* `words`.

You must write an algorithm with O(sum of `words[i].length`) runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["a",""]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["a","a"]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `0 <= words[i].length <= 300`
*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Approach(es)

### Hash Map Approach (Optimized)

Algorithm:

1.  **Create a Hash Map:** Create a hash map (`word_map`) where keys are the words and values are their corresponding indices in the `words` array.
2.  **Iterate Through Words:** Iterate through each word `word` and its index `i` in the `words` array.
3.  **Handle Empty String:** If the empty string `""` is in `word_map` and the current `word` is not empty and is a palindrome, then we have found two palindrome pairs: `(i, word_map[""])` and `(word_map[""], i)`.
4.  **Handle Reversed Word:** Check if the reverse of the entire `word` exists in `word_map`. If it exists and its index is different from `i`, then we have found a palindrome pair: `(i, word_map[reversed_word])`.
5.  **Handle Prefixes and Suffixes:** Iterate through all possible prefixes and suffixes of the current `word`.
    *   For each prefix and suffix:
        *   Check if the suffix is a palindrome. If it is, check if the reverse of the prefix exists in `word_map`. If it does, we have found a palindrome pair: `(i, word_map[reversed_prefix])`.
        *   Check if the prefix is a palindrome. If it is, check if the reverse of the suffix exists in `word_map`. If it does, we have found a palindrome pair: `(word_map[reversed_suffix], i)`.
6. **Return Result**

Data Structures:

*   Hash Map (Dictionary): To store words and their indices for efficient lookup.

Time Complexity:

*   O(n * k^2), where n is the number of words and k is the maximum length of a word.  The outer loop iterates through n words. The inner loop (checking prefixes and suffixes) iterates up to k times.  The palindrome check (`is_palindrome`) takes O(k) time.  However, since the sum of word lengths is constrained, and we're checking prefixes/suffixes, it effectively acts like O(sum of `words[i].length`).  This satisfies the problem constraint.

Space Complexity:

*   O(n), where n is the number of words. The hash map stores all the words.

Trade-offs:

*   This approach uses a hash map to efficiently find potential palindrome pairs, avoiding the need to compare every pair of words directly.  The careful handling of prefixes, suffixes, and the empty string ensures that all valid palindrome pairs are found.

[Hash Map Approach](./solution.py)

## Notes

*   The problem requires a solution with O(sum of `words[i].length`) time complexity, which rules out brute-force (O(n^2 * k)) solutions.
*   The hash map approach provides an efficient way to find potential matches by leveraging the properties of palindromes and their prefixes/suffixes.  The key is to break down the problem into cases based on how the palindrome can be formed (whole word reversed, prefix/suffix palindromes).
