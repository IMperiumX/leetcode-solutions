Okay, let's process this LeetCode problem and create the repository.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

The input is a URL: `https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/description/`

From this URL, we can determine:

*   **Problem Number:** This isn't directly in the URL, but this is a premium problem, and usually it would. We'll proceed, but a clarification step would be ideal in a real interactive system. We can find from the webpage that the problem number is **285**.
*   **Problem Name:** Inorder Successor in BST
*   **Difficulty:** Medium (also visible on the LeetCode page).

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0285-inorder-successor-in-bst`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since no solution code was provided, let's generate a Python solution.  There are two main approaches: one using the BST properties (more efficient), and another that performs a full inorder traversal (less efficient but works on any binary tree). We'll create both.

**solution_bst.py:**

```python
# 0285. Inorder Successor in BST - BST Property Approach

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def inorderSuccessor(root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
    """
    Finds the inorder successor of node p in a BST.

    Leverages the BST property for efficiency.

    Args:
        root: The root of the BST.
        p: The node for which to find the successor.

    Returns:
        The inorder successor node, or None if p is the last node.
    """
    successor = None

    while root:
        if p.val < root.val:
            successor = root  # Potential successor found, go left
            root = root.left
        else:
            root = root.right  # p.val >= root.val, go right

    return successor
```

**solution_inorder.py:**

```python
# 0285. Inorder Successor in BST - Inorder Traversal Approach

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def inorderSuccessor(root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
    """
    Finds the inorder successor of node p in a binary tree (not necessarily a BST).

    Performs a full inorder traversal.  Less efficient than the BST-specific approach.

    Args:
        root: The root of the binary tree.
        p: The node for which to find the successor.

    Returns:
        The inorder successor node, or None if p is the last node.
    """
    prev = None
    stack = []
    curr = root

    while curr or stack:
        while curr:
            stack.append(curr)
            curr = curr.left

        curr = stack.pop()

        if prev == p:
            return curr

        prev = curr
        curr = curr.right

    return None
```

**Step 4: README.md Generation**

We'll create `README.md` inside the `0285-inorder-successor-in-bst` directory.

# 285. Inorder Successor in BST, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return *the in-order successor of that node in the BST*. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
*   `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
*   All Node.val are unique.

## Approach(es)

### BST Property Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with `successor = None`.
2.  **Iterate:** While `root` is not `None`:
    *   If `p.val` is less than `root.val`, then the successor *could* be in the left subtree, or it could be the current `root`.  So, we update `successor = root` and move to the left subtree (`root = root.left`).
    *   Otherwise (`p.val` is greater than or equal to `root.val`), the successor must be in the right subtree (or doesn't exist).  So, we move to the right subtree (`root = root.right`).
3.  **Return:**  Return the final `successor` value.

**Data Structures:**

*   No extra data structures are used.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(H), where H is the height of the tree.  In the worst case (skewed tree), H = N (number of nodes), giving O(N). In the best case (balanced tree), H = log N, giving O(log N).

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach is very efficient because it leverages the properties of a Binary Search Tree.  It avoids traversing the entire tree.

### Inorder Traversal Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize:** Use a stack for iterative inorder traversal, and a `prev` variable to track the previously visited node.
2.  **Iterate:** Perform a standard iterative inorder traversal:
    *   Push left children onto the stack until a leaf is reached.
    *   Pop a node from the stack.
    *   If the `prev` node is equal to `p`, then the current node is the successor; return it.
    *   Update `prev` to the current node.
    *   Move to the right child of the current node.
3.  **Return:** If the loop completes without finding the successor, return `None`.

**Data Structures:**

*   Stack: Used for the iterative inorder traversal.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  We potentially visit every node in the tree.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(H) in average case, where H is the height of the tree (due to the stack). In the worst case (skewed tree), H = N, leading to O(N) space. In a balanced tree, H = log N, giving O(log N).

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach works for *any* binary tree, not just BSTs.
*   It's less efficient than the BST-specific approach because it always performs a full inorder traversal.

**Step 5: Topic Extraction and Files**

The relevant topics are:

1.  **Tree:** This problem deals with binary trees.
2.  **Binary Search Tree (BST):**  The problem specifically mentions BSTs, and one of the solutions utilizes BST properties.
3.  **Tree Traversal:**  One solution uses inorder traversal.
4. **Stack** One solution requires stack data structure.

We create files: `Tree.md`, `Binary Search Tree.md`, `Tree Traversal.md`, `Stack.md`.

**Tree.md:** (Same as in the previous example, but with the addition of this problem)

```

**Binary Search Tree.md:**

```markdown
# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree that has the following properties:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *less than* the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *greater than* the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

These properties allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of nodes.

**Advantages of BSTs:**

*   **Efficient Search:** Searching for a node in a balanced BST takes O(log N) time on average, where N is the number of nodes.
*   **Ordered Data:**  Inorder traversal of a BST yields the nodes in sorted order.
* **Efficient Insertion/Deletion**: Insert and Deletion operations take O(log N) on average.

**Disadvantages of BSTs:**

*   **Worst-Case Performance:**  If the tree becomes unbalanced (e.g., a skewed tree), operations can degrade to O(N) time.  Self-balancing BSTs (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) address this issue.

```

**Stack.md:**

```markdown
# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.  This means that the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed.  Think of a stack of plates: you add new plates to the top, and you remove plates from the top as well.

**Basic Stack Operations:**

*   **push(item):** Adds an item to the top of the stack.
*   **pop():** Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
*   **peek():** Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
*   **is_empty():** Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
*  **size()**: Return the number of items on the stack.

**Applications of Stacks:**

*   **Function Call Stack:**  Stacks are used to manage function calls in programming languages.
*   **Expression Evaluation:**  Stacks are used to evaluate arithmetic expressions (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Stacks can be used to implement undo/redo features in applications.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Stacks are used implicitly (via recursion) or explicitly in DFS algorithms.
* **Backtracking algorithms**
