Okay, let's generate the LeetCode solution repository for the "Maximal Square" problem.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Prompt 1**: "Identify the LeetCode problem from the following input: `221. Maximal Square ... [rest of the problem description]`."

*   **Output**: "Problem Number: 221, Problem Name: Maximal Square, Difficulty: Medium"

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

*   Create a directory named `0221-maximal-square`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

*   **Prompt 3.2**: "Generate solutions in Python for the LeetCode problem: `Maximal Square` (Number: `221`). The solutions should be well-commented. Create files named `solution.py`..."

    *   I will implement a Dynamic Programming (DP) solution, which is the most efficient approach for this problem.

    *   **`solution.py` (DP Approach):**

    ```python
    # 221. Maximal Square - Dynamic Programming Approach

    def maximalSquare(matrix: list[list[str]]) -> int:
        """
        Finds the largest square containing only 1's in a binary matrix and returns its area.

        Args:
            matrix: The input m x n binary matrix (list of lists of strings).

        Returns:
            The area of the largest square containing only 1's.
        """
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0

        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]  # DP table to store side lengths of squares
        max_side = 0

        # Iterate through the matrix
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                    if i == 0 or j == 0:
                        dp[i][j] = 1  # Base case: first row and first column
                    else:
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1
                    max_side = max(max_side, dp[i][j])

        return max_side * max_side  # Return the area (side * side)
    ```

    * I will also generate a solution using optimized dynamic programming (space optimized).
   *   **`solution_optimized_dp.py` (Optimized DP Approach):**

        if not matrix:
            return 0

        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp = [0] * (cols + 1)  # Use 1D array for DP table
        max_side = 0
        prev = 0  # Store the top-left diagonal value (dp[i-1][j-1])

        for i in range(1, rows + 1):
            for j in range(1, cols + 1):
                temp = dp[j]  # Store current dp[j] before it's updated (to use as prev)
                if matrix[i - 1][j - 1] == '1':
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j - 1], prev, dp[j]) + 1
                    max_side = max(max_side, dp[j])
                else:
                    dp[j] = 0  # Reset to 0 if current element is '0'
                prev = temp  # Update prev for the next iteration

        return max_side * max_side

    ```
**Step 4: Problem README Generation**

*   **Prompt 4**: "Generate a `README.md` file for the problem: `Maximal Square` (Number: `221`, Difficulty: `Medium`)."

    *   **`README.md`:**

    # 221. Maximal Square, Difficulty: Medium

    ## Problem Description

    Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

    Example 1:

    Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
    Output: 4

    Example 2:

    Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
    Output: 1

    Example 3:

    Input: matrix = [["0"]]
    Output: 0

    Constraints:

    m == matrix.length
    n == matrix[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 300
    matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

    ## Approach(es)

    ### Dynamic Programming Approach

    Algorithm:

    1.  **Initialization:**
        *   Handle edge cases: If the matrix is empty or has no rows/columns, return 0.
        *   Get the dimensions of the matrix: `m` (rows), `n` (columns).
        *   Create a DP table `dp` of the same size as the matrix, initialized with all 0s. `dp[i][j]` will store the *side length* of the largest square ending at position `(i, j)`.
        *   Initialize `max_side` to 0, to keep track of the maximum side length found so far.

    2.  **Iterate through the Matrix:**
        *   Iterate through the matrix using nested loops (rows `i` from 0 to m-1, columns `j` from 0 to n-1).
        *   **Check for '1':**  If `matrix[i][j]` is '1':
            *   **Base Cases (First Row/Column):** If `i` or `j` is 0 (first row or first column), set `dp[i][j]` to 1 (a single '1' forms a square of side 1).
            *   **General Case:** Otherwise, the side length of the largest square ending at `(i, j)` is determined by the minimum side length of the squares ending at its top, left, and top-left neighbors, plus 1.  So, `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1`.
            *   **Update `max_side`:** Update `max_side` with the maximum of its current value and `dp[i][j]`.

    3.  **Return Area:** Return `max_side * max_side` (the area of the largest square).

    Data Structures:

    -   2D DP table (`dp`):  Stores the side lengths of the largest squares ending at each cell.

    Time Complexity:

    -   O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. We iterate through each cell of the matrix once.

    Space Complexity:

    -   O(m * n) for the DP table.

    Trade-offs:
     - Uses additional space to achieve optimal solution.

    ### Optimized Dynamic Programming Approach

    Algorithm:

    The space-optimized DP approach reduces the space complexity from O(m*n) to O(n) by using only a 1D DP array.

    1.  **Initialization:**
        *   Handle empty matrix case.
        *   `rows`, `cols`: Dimensions of the matrix.
        *   `dp`: 1D array of size `cols + 1`, initialized with 0s. This array will store the DP values for the *current* row being processed.
        *   `max_side`:  Keeps track of the maximum side length.
        *   `prev`: Stores the value of `dp[i-1][j-1]` (the top-left diagonal element) from the previous iteration.

    2.  **Iteration:**
        *   Iterate through rows (from 1 to `rows`) and columns (from 1 to `cols`).  Note: We're using 1-based indexing for convenience with the `dp` array.
        *   `temp = dp[j]`: Store the *current* value of `dp[j]` *before* it's updated. This is crucial because we'll need this value as `prev` in the next column iteration.
        *   If `matrix[i-1][j-1] == '1'`:
            *   `dp[j] = min(dp[j-1], prev, dp[j]) + 1`  (The same DP recurrence relation as before, but using the 1D array).
            *   `max_side = max(max_side, dp[j])`
        *   Else (`matrix[i-1][j-1] == '0'`):
            *   `dp[j] = 0`  (Reset `dp[j]` to 0, as a '0' cannot be part of a square).
        *   `prev = temp`: Update `prev` with the original value of `dp[j]` for the next column iteration.

    3.  **Return Area:** Return `max_side * max_side`.

    Data Structures:

    -   1D DP array (`dp`): Stores DP values for the current row.

    Time Complexity:

    -   O(m * n) - Same as the 2D DP approach.

    Space Complexity:

    -   O(min(m,n)) as the dp array size is based on col size + 1.

    Trade-offs:

     - Reduces the memory used while achieving the same result.

    [Dynamic Programming Approach](./solution.py)
    [Optimized Dynamic Programming Approach](./solution_optimized_dp.py)
    ## Notes (Optional)

    The dynamic programming approach provides an efficient way to solve this problem by building up solutions from smaller subproblems. The optimized DP solution further reduces space complexity by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array, making it more memory-efficient, especially when the number of columns is significantly smaller than the number of rows.
    ```
All necessary files (`solution.py`, `solution_optimized_dp.py`, `README.md`) are created inside the `0221-maximal-square` directory. The README correctly links to both solutions and the explanations and analysis are complete and well structured.
