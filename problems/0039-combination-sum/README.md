Okay, let's break this down into the steps and generate the LeetCode solution repository.

Companies
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the
frequency
 of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

 

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
Example 3:

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
 

Constraints:

1 <= candidates.length <= 30
2 <= candidates[i] <= 40
All elements of candidates are distinct.
1 <= target <= 40
```

Based on this, we can identify:

*   **Problem Number:** 39
*   **Problem Name:** Combination Sum
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

We'll create a directory named `0039-combination-sum`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

Since the user *didn't* provide a solution, we'll generate one in Python, showcasing a backtracking approach.

```python
# 0039. Combination Sum - Backtracking Approach

def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    result = []

    def backtrack(combination, remaining, start):
        if remaining == 0:
            result.append(combination.copy())  # Append a copy to avoid modification
            return

        if remaining < 0:
            return

        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            combination.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(combination, remaining - candidates[i], i) # i not i+1 because we can reuse same element
            combination.pop() # Backtrack: remove the last element

    backtrack([], target, 0)
    return result

```

This code will be saved as `0039-combination-sum/solution.py`.  I'll also generate an alternative, more descriptive filename.
```python
# 0039. Combination Sum - Backtracking Approach

def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    res = []

    def backtrack(cur, pos, target):
        if target == 0:
            res.append(cur.copy())
            return
        if target <= 0:
            return

        prev = -1
        for i in range(pos, len(candidates)):
            if candidates[i] == prev:
                continue
            cur.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(cur, i, target - candidates[i])
            cur.pop()
            prev = candidates[i]

    backtrack([], 0, target)
    return res
```
This code will be saved as `0039-combination-sum/solution_backtracking.py`.

# 39. Combination Sum, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a *list of all **unique** combinations* of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
*   `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
*   All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
*   `1 <= target <= 40`

## Approach(es)

### Backtracking Approach

The core idea is to explore all possible combinations by recursively adding candidates to a current combination and checking if they sum up to the target.  Since we can reuse numbers, we don't increment the index in the recursive call.

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an empty list `result` to store the valid combinations.
    *   Define a recursive helper function `backtrack(combination, remaining, start)`:
        *   `combination`: The current combination being built.
        *   `remaining`: The remaining sum needed to reach the target.
        *   `start`: The starting index in `candidates` to avoid duplicates.

2.  **Base Cases (within `backtrack`):**
    *   If `remaining == 0`:  A valid combination is found. Add a *copy* of `combination` to `result`.
    *   If `remaining < 0`:  The current combination exceeds the target; backtrack.

3.  **Recursive Step (within `backtrack`):**
    *   Iterate through `candidates` from the `start` index:
        *   Add the current candidate (`candidates[i]`) to `combination`.
        *   Recursively call `backtrack` with the updated `combination`, `remaining - candidates[i]`, and `i` (to allow reuse of the same number).
        *   Remove the last added element (`candidates[i]`) from `combination` (backtracking step).

4.  **Initial Call:** Call `backtrack([], target, 0)` to start the process.

5.  **Return:** Return the `result` list.
**Data Structures:**

*   `result`: A list to store the resulting combinations (list of lists).
*   `combination`: A list to hold the current combination being built during recursion.

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(N^(T/M + 1)), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimal value among the candidates. In the worst-case scenario, we might have to explore all possible combinations.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(T/M),  This is due to the recursion depth, which is at most the target divided by minimum candidate.

**Trade-offs:**

*   The backtracking approach is generally efficient for this problem, as it explores only valid combinations.
*   The space complexity is primarily determined by the recursion depth.

## Code

[Backtracking Approach](./solution_backtracking.py)

## Notes (Optional)

*   The problem explicitly states that the input numbers are distinct, simplifying the logic for avoiding duplicates.
*   The constraint on the number of combinations being less than 150 helps limit the recursion depth in practice.

# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to a computational problem, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

## Key Concepts

- **Candidate Solutions:** Backtracking algorithms explore a search space of potential solutions. These solutions are built incrementally.
- **Partial Candidates:** At each step, the algorithm considers a partial candidate solution.
- **Constraints:**  The problem defines constraints that a valid solution must satisfy.
- **Abandonment:** If a partial candidate violates the constraints, or can be determined to *never* lead to a valid solution, the algorithm "backtracks" â€“ it abandons that candidate and explores other possibilities.
- **Recursive Structure:**  Backtracking is often implemented recursively, as each step builds upon the previous one.  The recursive calls represent the exploration of different branches in the search space.

## How Backtracking Works (General Steps)

1. **Start:** Begin with an empty or initial partial candidate solution.

2. **Choice:** Make a choice to extend the current partial candidate. This often involves adding an element to a set, assigning a value to a variable, or making a move in a game.

3. **Constraint Check:**
    - Check if the extended partial candidate still satisfies all the problem's constraints.
    - If the constraints are violated, undo the choice (backtrack) and try a different choice.
    -If it is impossible to make a valid choice, backtrack.

4. **Goal Test:**
    - If the extended partial candidate is a complete solution (satisfies all constraints *and* represents a full solution), record it (e.g., add it to a result set).

5. **Recursion/Iteration:**
    - If the extended partial candidate is not a complete solution, but is still valid, recursively apply steps 2-4 to further extend it.
    - After exploring all possible choices for a given partial candidate, backtrack to the previous level.

6. **Termination:** The algorithm terminates when all possible candidate solutions have been explored, or when a sufficient number of solutions have been found.

## Example Problems

*   **N-Queens:** Placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
*   **Sudoku Solver:** Filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9.
*   **Subset Sum:** Finding a subset of a given set of numbers that sums to a specific target value.
*  **Combination Sum:** [39. Combination Sum](./0039-combination-sum/README.md)
*   **Permutations:** Generating all possible permutations of a given set of elements.
*   **Graph Coloring:** Assigning colors to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

## Advantages of Backtracking

*   **Systematic Exploration:** Guarantees to find all solutions (if they exist) by systematically exploring the search space.
*   **Handles Constraints:**  Effectively deals with problems that have complex constraints.
*   **Relatively Easy to Implement:** The recursive nature often makes the implementation straightforward (although debugging can be challenging).

## Disadvantages of Backtracking

*   **Exponential Time Complexity:** In the worst case, backtracking can have exponential time complexity (O(2^N) or worse), as it may need to explore all possible combinations.
*   **Not Always Efficient:** For some problems, there may be more efficient algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) than backtracking.  However, backtracking provides a good starting point and is often the easiest solution to conceptualize.

## Optimization Techniques

*   **Pruning:**  Identify and eliminate branches of the search space that are guaranteed *not* to lead to a solution *early* on.  This is the most important optimization.
*   **Heuristics:**  Use heuristics to guide the search towards more promising branches.  For example, in the N-Queens problem, you might prioritize placing queens in rows/columns with fewer conflicts.
*   **Constraint Propagation:**  After making a choice, deduce the consequences of that choice on other variables and update the constraints accordingly.
*   **Memoization (for overlapping subproblems):** In some cases, you can store the results of intermediate computations to avoid redundant calculations (similar to dynamic programming).  This is not always applicable to backtracking problems.

Backtracking is a fundamental algorithmic technique that is widely applicable to a variety of problems. While it can be computationally expensive, its systematic nature and ability to handle constraints make it a powerful tool for problem-solving. Understanding pruning and other optimization techniques is key to using backtracking effectively.

# Arrays

Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science. They are used to store collections of elements of the same data type, accessed using integer indices.  Understanding arrays is crucial for solving many LeetCode problems.

## Key Concepts

*   **Contiguous Memory:** Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations. This means that the elements are stored one after another in memory.
*   **Fixed Size (in many languages):**  In languages like C, C++, and Java, arrays often have a fixed size that must be declared at compile time (or when the array is created).  Dynamic arrays (like `std::vector` in C++ or `ArrayList` in Java) can resize, but this often involves copying the entire array to a new memory location. Python lists are dynamic arrays.
*   **Zero-Based Indexing (usually):**  Most programming languages use zero-based indexing for arrays.  This means the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. The last element is at index `length - 1`.
*   **Data Type Homogeneity:**  Typically, all elements in an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all floats, all characters).  Some languages (like Python) allow for heterogeneous lists, but this comes with performance trade-offs.
*   **Random Access:**  Arrays provide *random access*.  This means that you can access any element in the array directly using its index in O(1) (constant) time. This is a major advantage of arrays.

## Common Array Operations and Time Complexities

| Operation            | Time Complexity | Description                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access (by index)    | O(1)            | Retrieving the value at a specific index.                                                                                          |
| Update (by index)    | O(1)            | Changing the value at a specific index.                                                                                            |
| Insertion (at end)  | O(1) (amortized for dynamic arrays), O(n) worst-case      | Adding an element to the end of the array.  For dynamic arrays, this is usually O(1), but can be O(n) if resizing is required. |
| Insertion (at beginning/middle) | O(n) | Adding element in any other position than the end.|
| Deletion (at end)   | O(1) (amortized for dynamic arrays), O(n) for static arrays | Removing the last element. Similar to insertion, dynamic arrays can sometimes require resizing.                                      |
| Deletion (at beginning/middle)  | O(n)            | Removing an element from the beginning or middle requires shifting all subsequent elements, hence O(n).                            |
| Search (linear)      | O(n)            | Iterating through the array to find a specific value.                                                                              |
| Search (binary, *if sorted*) | O(log n)         | If the array is sorted, you can use binary search to find an element much faster.                                               |
| Copy                 | O(n)            | Creating a new array with the same elements.                                                                                      |
| Get Length           | O(1)            | Determining the number of elements in the array.                                                                                   |

## Types of Arrays

*   **Static Arrays:**  Fixed size, determined at compile time.  Common in C/C++.
*   **Dynamic Arrays:**  Can grow or shrink in size as needed.  Examples include `std::vector` in C++, `ArrayList` in Java, and lists in Python.  Resizing usually involves allocating a new, larger block of memory and copying the elements.  This makes occasional insertion/deletion operations O(n), but *amortized* over many operations, the average time complexity is often considered O(1).
*   **Multidimensional Arrays:**  Arrays of arrays.  Used to represent matrices, grids, tables, etc.  A 2D array is like a grid with rows and columns. Accessing an element requires two indices (e.g., `arr[row][col]`).  Higher-dimensional arrays are also possible.

## Python Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

Python lists are a versatile and commonly used implementation of dynamic arrays.  Here are some key features:

*   **Dynamic Sizing:** Lists automatically resize as you add or remove elements.
*   **Heterogeneous Elements:** Python lists can store elements of different data types (although it's generally good practice to keep them homogeneous for clarity and efficiency).
*   **List Comprehensions:** Python offers concise syntax for creating and manipulating lists using list comprehensions.
*   **Slicing:** Python allows you to extract portions of a list (sublists) using slicing (e.g., `my_list[2:5]`).
* **Methods:**  Python lists have many built-in methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc.

## Tips for LeetCode Array Problems

*   **Understand the Constraints:** Pay close attention to the size of the array and the range of values. This can often hint at the appropriate algorithm and data structures.
*   **Consider Sorting:** If the problem involves searching or finding specific combinations, consider whether sorting the array could help.
*   **Use Hash Tables (Dictionaries):** For problems that require frequent lookups or checking for duplicates, hash tables (dictionaries in Python) can provide O(1) average-case complexity for these operations.
*   **Two-Pointer Technique:** For problems involving sorted arrays or finding pairs/triplets that meet certain conditions, the two-pointer technique can be very efficient.
*   **Sliding Window:** For problems involving subarrays or subsequences of a fixed or variable size, the sliding window technique can be useful.
*   **In-Place Operations:**  Whenever possible, try to modify the array in-place (without creating a new array) to save space.
*   **Think about Edge Cases:**  Consider empty arrays, arrays with one element, arrays with duplicate elements, and other edge cases.

Arrays are a fundamental building block for many algorithms.  Mastering array manipulation techniques is essential for success on LeetCode.
