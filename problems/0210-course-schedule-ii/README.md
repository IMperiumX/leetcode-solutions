## Problem Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return *any* of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an *empty array*.

**Example 1:**

Input: `numCourses = 2`, `prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
Output: `[0,1]`
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is `[0,1]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: `numCourses = 4`, `prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`
Output: `[0,2,1,3]`
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is `[0,1,2,3]`. Another correct ordering is `[0,2,1,3]`.

**Example 3:**

Input: `numCourses = 1`, `prerequisites = []`
Output: `[0]`

Constraints:

*   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
*   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
*   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are distinct.

## Approach(es)

### Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm - BFS)

This problem can be solved using topological sorting.  A topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.  If the graph contains a cycle, a topological sort is not possible.

Kahn's algorithm is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) based approach for topological sorting.

Algorithm:

1.  **Build Graph and In-Degree:**
    *   Create an adjacency list `graph` to represent the course dependencies (edges). `graph[i]` will store a list of courses that depend on course `i`.
    *   Create an `in_degree` array to store the number of incoming edges for each course.  `in_degree[i]` represents the number of prerequisites for course `i`.
    *   Iterate through the `prerequisites` list.  For each pair `[ai, bi]`, add an edge from `bi` to `ai` in the `graph` (i.e., `graph[bi].append(ai)`) and increment `in_degree[ai]`.

2.  **Initialize Queue:** Create a queue `queue` and add all courses with an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites) to the queue.

3.  **BFS Traversal:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a course `course` from the `queue`.
    *   Add `course` to the `result` list (the topological order).
    *   For each `neighbor` (course that depends on `course`) in `graph[course]`:
        *   Decrement `in_degree[neighbor]` (since we've "taken" `course`).
        *   If `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0, add `neighbor` to the `queue`.

4.  **Cycle Detection:** After the BFS traversal, if the length of the `result` list is equal to `numCourses`, it means all courses were processed, and we have a valid topological sort.  Otherwise, there was a cycle in the graph, and no valid order exists.

Data Structures:

*   `graph`: Adjacency list (list of lists).
*   `in_degree`: Array to store in-degrees.
*   `queue`: Queue for BFS.
*  `result`: result array.

Time Complexity:

*   O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (`numCourses`) and E is the number of prerequisites (length of `prerequisites`).  Building the graph and in-degree array takes O(E) time.  The BFS traversal visits each vertex and edge once.

Space Complexity:

*   O(V + E) - The adjacency list `graph` can take up to O(E) space, the `in_degree` array takes O(V) space, and the queue can hold up to O(V) elements in the worst case.

Trade-offs:
- Kahn's Algorithm is very efficient to find topological sorting.
- BFS based.

### Topological Sort (DFS)
This approach uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine a valid course schedule. The core idea is to detect cycles and, if no cycles are present, construct the topological ordering by adding courses to the result list in post-order (after visiting all their dependencies).
Algorithm:

1. **Build Graph:**
    - Create an adjacency list, graph, where graph[i] is a list of courses that depend on course i (i.e., the courses that have i as a prerequisite).
    - Initialize a visited array to keep track of the visitation status of each course during DFS. It can have three states:
        - 0: Unvisited
        - 1: Currently being visited (in the current DFS path)
        - 2: Visited (and all its dependencies have been explored)
    - Initialize an empty result list to store the topological order.

2. **DFS Function (dfs(course)):**
    - **Cycle Detection:**
       - If visited[course] is 1, it means we've encountered a course that is currently being visited, indicating a cycle. Return True (cycle detected).
       - If visited[course] is 2, it means this course and all its dependencies have already been processed, so we can skip it. Return False (no cycle).
     - **Mark as Visiting:** Set visited[course] to 1 to indicate that we are currently visiting this course.
     - **Explore Dependencies:** Iterate through each neighbor (dependent course) of the current course:
       - Recursively call dfs(neighbor). If the recursive call returns True (cycle detected), propagate the True value upwards.
     - **Mark as Visited:** After exploring all dependencies, set visited[course] to 2, indicating that this course and all its prerequisites have been processed.
     - **Add to Result (Post-order):** Add the current course to the result list.  This ensures that courses are added only after all their dependencies have been added.
     - **Return False:** Return False to indicate that no cycle was detected in this branch.
3. **Main Loop:**
    - Iterate through all courses from 0 to numCourses - 1.
    - For each course, call the dfs function. If dfs returns True, it means a cycle was detected, so return an empty list [].
4. **Reverse Result:**
Since courses are added to result in post-order during DFS, reverse the result list to obtain the correct topological ordering.

Data Structures:
- `graph`: Adjacency list (list of lists) to represent the course dependencies.
- `visited`: An array to track the visitation status of each course during DFS.
- `result`: A list to store the topological order of courses.

Time Complexity:

- O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (numCourses) and E is the number of prerequisites. Building the graph takes O(E) time, and the DFS traversal visits each vertex and edge at most once.

Space Complexity:

- O(V + E). The adjacency list graph takes up to O(E) space, and the visited array and the recursion call stack both take O(V) space.

Tradeoffs:
- DFS is very efficient way for topological sorting and detecting cycles.
- Recursive.

## Notes
- This is classic Topological Sort problem.
- Topological sorting is only possible for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). If there's a cycle, it's impossible to determine a valid order.
- The problem asks for *any* valid ordering. There might be multiple valid orderings, and the algorithms will produce one of them.
- The BFS-based Kahn's algorithm and the DFS-based approach are both standard ways to solve topological sorting problems.

# Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects.

## Key Concepts

- **Vertex (Node):**  A fundamental unit of a graph.  Represents an object or entity.
- **Edge:** A connection between two vertices.  Represents a relationship between the objects.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph):**  A graph where edges have a direction (from one vertex to another).
- **Undirected Graph:** A graph where edges have no direction (connections are bidirectional).
- **Weighted Graph:** A graph where edges have associated weights (e.g., representing costs, distances, or capacities).
- **Unweighted Graph:**  A graph where edges have no weights.
- **Adjacent Vertices:** Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.
- **Degree (of a vertex):** The number of edges connected to a vertex. In a directed graph, we distinguish between *in-degree* (number of incoming edges) and *out-degree* (number of outgoing edges).
- **Path:** A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
- **Cycle:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- **Connected Graph:** An undirected graph where there is a path between any two vertices.
- **Disconnected Graph:** An undirected graph that is not connected.
- **Strongly Connected Graph:** A directed graph where there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex.
- **Weakly Connected Graph:** A directed graph that would be connected if the directions on the edges were ignored.
- **Complete Graph:** A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.
- **Sparse Graph:** A graph with relatively few edges compared to the maximum possible number of edges.
- **Dense Graph:**  A graph with many edges close to maximum possible number of edges.

## Representations

- **Adjacency Matrix:**  A 2D array where `matrix[i][j]` represents the presence or absence of an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.  For weighted graphs, the matrix can store the edge weights.
    - *Space Complexity:* O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices.
    - *Advantages:*  Checking if an edge exists between two vertices is O(1).
    - *Disadvantages:*  Space-inefficient for sparse graphs.
- **Adjacency List:**  An array of lists, where `list[i]` stores the vertices adjacent to vertex `i`.
    - *Space Complexity:* O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
    - *Advantages:*  Space-efficient for sparse graphs.
    - *Disadvantages:*  Checking if an edge exists can take O(degree(vertex)) time.
- **Edge List:** A list of pairs (or triples for weighted graphs) representing the edges.
     - *Space Complexity:* O(E)

## Common Operations and Algorithms

- **Traversal:**
    - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  Visits vertices level by level.
    - **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Visits vertices by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Shortest Path:**
    - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
    - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**  Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, and can detect negative cycles.
    - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**  Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):**
    - **Prim's Algorithm:** Finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted, undirected graph.
    - **Kruskal's Algorithm:**  Finds a minimum spanning tree.
- **Connectivity:**
    - **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):**  A data structure for efficiently determining connected components.
- **Topological Sort:**  A linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

## Use Cases

# Topological Sort

Topological sorting for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v) from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.  If the graph is not a DAG (i.e., it contains a cycle), a topological sort is not possible.

## Key Concepts

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** A directed graph with no cycles.
- **In-Degree:** The number of incoming edges to a vertex.
- **Linear Ordering:**  An arrangement of vertices in a sequence.
- **Source Node:** A node with an in-degree of 0.

## Algorithms for Topological Sorting

### 1. Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based)

Algorithm:

1.  **Compute In-Degrees:** Calculate the in-degree of each vertex.
2.  **Initialize Queue:** Add all vertices with an in-degree of 0 to a queue.
3.  **Process Queue:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   Dequeue a vertex `u` from the queue.
    *   Add `u` to the topological ordering.
    *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` (i.e., for each edge (u, v)):
        *   Decrement the in-degree of `v`.
        *   If the in-degree of `v` becomes 0, add `v` to the queue.
4. **Cycle Detection:** If the number of visited vertices is not equal to the total number of vertices in the graph, then the graph contains a cycle, and a topological sort is not possible.

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS-based)

Algorithm:

1.  **Visited Array:** Create a `visited` array to keep track of the visitation status of vertices (unvisited, visiting, visited).
2.  **DFS Function:**
    *   Mark the current vertex as "visiting".
    *   For each neighbor of the current vertex:
        *   If the neighbor is "visiting", a cycle is detected (return an error or signal a cycle).
        *   If the neighbor is unvisited, recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
    *   Mark the current vertex as "visited".
    *   Prepend the current vertex to the topological ordering (or add to stack).

3.  **Main Loop**: Iterate through all vertices in the graph. If vertex not visited call DFS.
4. **Return (or reverse):** Reverse the result list if added in prepend way.

## Time and Space Complexity (Both Algorithms)

*   **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(V + E) in the worst case, due to the adjacency list/matrix representation of the graph, the queue/stack, and potentially the in-degree array.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

*   **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS):**
    *   *Advantages:*  Often considered more intuitive.  Easy to implement.
    *   *Disadvantages:* No significant disadvantages compared to DFS.
*   **DFS:**
    *   *Advantages:* Can be slightly more concise to implement recursively.
    *   *Disadvantages:* Can be more prone to stack overflow errors for very deep graphs if implemented recursively.

## Use Cases

- **Task Scheduling:**  Determining the order in which to execute tasks with dependencies.
- **Course Scheduling:**  Finding a valid order to take courses with prerequisites.
- **Build Systems:**  Determining the order in which to compile files in a software project.
- **Data Serialization:**  Ensuring that objects are serialized in the correct order based on their dependencies.
- **Spreadsheet Cell Evaluation:** Calculating the values of cells in a spreadsheet in the correct order.

Breadth-First Search.md:
# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## Key Concepts

- **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a graph or tree.
- **Level-by-Level Exploration:**  Exploring nodes layer by layer, starting from the root/source node.
- **Queue:** BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.
- **Visited Set:**  Used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles (especially in graphs).

## How BFS Works

1.  **Start:**  Enqueue the starting node (root or source) into a queue and mark it as visited.
2.  **Loop:** While the queue is not empty:
    *   **Dequeue:** Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
    *   **Process:** Process the dequeued node (e.g., print its value, check if it's the target, etc.).
    *   **Enqueue Neighbors:**  For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
        *   Mark the neighbor as visited.
        *   Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.

## Advantages

- **Finds Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):**  BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) between the starting node and any other reachable node in an *unweighted* graph.
- **Complete:**  BFS will eventually visit all reachable nodes in the graph.

## Disadvantages

- **Memory Usage:** BFS can use more memory than Depth-First Search (DFS) if the graph is very wide (has many nodes at each level).  The queue can grow to store all nodes at a given level.

## Use Cases

- **Shortest Path (Unweighted Graphs):** Finding the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Web Crawling:**  Exploring web pages by following links level by level.
- **Social Networks:**  Finding connections between people within a certain degree of separation.
- **Network Broadcasting:**  Sending a message to all nodes in a network.
- **Garbage Collection:**  Identifying reachable objects in memory.
- **Level Order Traversal of Tree**

Depth-First Search.md:
# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Key Concepts

- **Traversal:** Visiting all nodes in a tree or graph.
- **Exploration:**  Following a path as deeply as possible before exploring other paths.
- **Backtracking:**  Returning to a previous node to explore unexplored branches.
- **Stack (or Recursion):**  DFS is typically implemented using a stack (explicitly or implicitly via recursion).
- **Visited Set:**  Used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles (especially in graphs).

## How DFS Works (Recursive Implementation)

1.  **Start:** Begin at the root (or a chosen starting node).
2.  **Mark Visited:** Mark the current node as visited.
3.  **Explore Neighbors:** For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
    *   Recursively call DFS on the neighbor.
4.  **Backtrack:**  Once all neighbors have been explored, return to the previous node (this happens automatically with recursion).

## How DFS Works (Iterative Implementation - Using a Stack)

1.  **Start:** Push the root (or starting node) onto a stack.
2.  **Loop:** While the stack is not empty:
    *   **Pop:** Pop a node from the stack.
    *   **Mark Visited:**  If the node has not been visited:
        *   Mark it as visited.
        *   **Push Neighbors:** Push all unvisited neighbors of the popped node onto the stack.

## Advantages

- **Simple Implementation:** Can be implemented concisely using recursion.
- **Memory Efficient (Sometimes):** For trees, DFS can be more memory-efficient than Breadth-First Search (BFS) if the tree is very wide but not very deep.
- **Finds Paths:** Useful for finding paths between nodes.

## Disadvantages

- **Not Guaranteed Shortest Path:**  DFS does not necessarily find the shortest path between two nodes (BFS is better for that).
- **Can Get Stuck in Deep Branches:**  In very deep trees or graphs, DFS might explore a very long path before finding a solution.
- **Stack Overflow (Recursion):**  Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.

## Use Cases

- Traversing trees and graphs.
- Finding connected components in a graph.
- Topological sorting.
- Detecting cycles in a graph.
- Solving puzzles (e.g., mazes).
