# 692. Top K Frequent Words, Difficulty: Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the **frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**

Input: `words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2`
Output: `["i","love"]`
Explanation: `"i"` and `"love"` are the two most frequent words.
Note that `"i"` comes before `"love"` due to a lower alphabetical order.

**Example 2:**

Input: `words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4`
Output: `["the","is","sunny","day"]`
Explanation: `"the"`, `"is"`, `"sunny"` and `"day"` are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 500`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `k` is in the range `[1, The number of unique words[i]]`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?

## Approach(es)

### Hash Map + Sorting Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Count Frequencies:** Use a hash map (Python's `Counter`) to count the frequency of each word.
2.  **Sort:** Sort the words based on two criteria:
    *   Frequency (descending order)
    *   Lexicographical order (ascending order) - This is used as a tie-breaker for words with the same frequency.
3.  **Return Top k:** Return the first `k` elements from the sorted list.

**Data Structures:**

*   Hash Map (`Counter`)

**Time Complexity:**

*   O(n log n), where `n` is the number of words. The dominant operation is sorting the words, which takes O(n log n) time. Counting frequencies takes O(n) time.

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n) -  We store the word frequencies in the hash map, which can take up to O(n) space in the worst case (all unique words).

**Trade-offs:**

*   Simple to implement, especially using Python's `Counter` and sorting capabilities.
*   The time complexity is O(n log n), which doesn't meet the follow-up requirement of O(n log k).

### Hash Map + Min-Heap Approach

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Count Frequencies:** Use a hash map (Python's `Counter`) to count the frequency of each word.
2.  **Min-Heap:** Use a min-heap (priority queue) to maintain the `k` most frequent words seen so far. We store tuples of `(-frequency, word)` in the heap.  The negative frequency is used because Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap, and we want to effectively track the *largest* frequencies.
3.  **Iterate and Heapify** : Build a Max Heap, using the min heap and extract top *k* frequent.

**Data Structures:**

*   Hash Map (`Counter`)
*   Min-Heap (`heapq` module in Python)

**Time Complexity:**

*    O(n log k), where `n` is the number of words and k is the parameter. Inserting in the head has O(logK)

**Space Complexity:**

*   O(n) - We store the frequencies in the hash map (O(n)) and the heap can contain up to `k` elements (O(k)), since *k* <= *n* in the worst-case is O(n)

**Trade-offs:**

*   This approach meets the follow-up requirement of O(n log k) time complexity.
*   Slightly more complex to implement than the sorting approach, but more efficient for large input sizes and small values of `k`.

# Hash Table

A hash table (hash map) is a data structure for key-value pairs, using a *hash function* to compute an *index* (hash code) into an array of *buckets*.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Hash Function:** Converts a key to a hash code (deterministic, efficient, uniform distribution).
*   **Collision:** Different keys, same hash code.
*   **Collision Resolution:**
    *   **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a linked list.
    *   **Open Addressing:** Probe for an empty slot (linear, quadratic, double hashing).

**Common Operations (Average):**

*   **Insertion:** O(1)
*   **Deletion:** O(1)
*   **Search:** O(1)

**Python:** `dict` is a hash table. `Counter` is a specialized dict.

# Heap (Priority Queue)

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the *heap property*:

*   **Min-Heap:**  The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its children. The minimum element is always at the root.
*   **Max-Heap:** The value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its children. The maximum element is always at the root.

Heaps are commonly used to implement *priority queues*. A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a "priority" associated with it.  Elements are dequeued based on their priority (highest or lowest, depending on whether it's a max-heap or min-heap).

**Key Properties:**

*   **Complete Binary Tree (Usually):**  Heaps are typically implemented as complete binary trees, meaning all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. This allows for efficient array-based representation.
*   **Heap Property:**  The relationship between parent and child nodes (min-heap or max-heap).

**Common Operations (for a heap of size k):**

*   **Insert (push):** O(log k) - Add a new element to the heap and "heapify" (restore the heap property) by bubbling up the element.
*   **Delete Min/Max (pop):** O(log k) - Remove the root element (min or max) and "heapify" by bubbling down the last element.
*   **Find Min/Max (peek):** O(1) - Access the root element.
*   **Heapify (build a heap from an array):** O(n) for an array of size n.

**Python's `heapq` Module:**

Python's `heapq` module provides an implementation of a *min-heap*.  To use it as a max-heap, you can store the negative of the values (for numeric data) or use tuples with the priority as the first element and negate it.

**Applications:**

*   Priority Queues
*   Heap Sort (O(n log n) sorting algorithm)
*   Finding the k largest/smallest elements in a stream of data
*   Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm)

# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, a fundamental data type for representing text.

**Key Properties:**

*   **Immutability (Often):** In Python, Java, JavaScript, strings are immutable. Operations create new strings.
*   **Mutability (Some):** C++ `std::string` is mutable.
*   **Character Encoding:** Bytes mapped to characters (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8).
* **Indexing and Slicing**: Access individual characters or sub-strings.

**Common Operations:**

*   **Concatenation:** Joining strings.
*   **Length:** Number of characters.
*   **Substring:** Extracting a portion.
*   **Comparison:** Lexicographical comparison.
*   **Searching:** Finding a substring.
*   **Splitting:** Dividing into substrings.
*   **Joining:** Combining strings.
*   **Case Conversion:** Uppercase/lowercase.
*   **Striping:** Remove whitespaces.

# Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). It's a fundamental operation in computer science with numerous applications.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Comparison-Based Sorting:**  Algorithms that compare elements to determine their relative order (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort).
*   **Non-Comparison-Based Sorting:** Algorithms that don't rely on comparisons (e.g., Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort). These can be faster than comparison-based sorts for specific types of data.
*   **Stability:** A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements.  For example, if you sort a list of people by age, and two people have the same age, a stable sort will keep them in the same order as they were in the original list.
*   **In-Place Sorting:**  An algorithm that sorts the data within the original array/list, without requiring significant extra memory (typically O(1) or O(log n) extra space).
* **Time and Space Complexity**

**Common Sorting Algorithms:**

| Merge Sort       | O(n log n)              | O(n log n)                | O(n log n)              | O(n)             | Yes    | No       | Efficient, general-purpose, stable sorting algorithm.                                         |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n)              | O(n log n)                | O(n^2)                   | O(log n) average | No     | Yes      | Efficient, general-purpose, but worst-case can be O(n^2) (often mitigated with randomization). |
| Heap Sort        | O(n log n)              | O(n log n)                | O(n log n)              | O(1)             | No     | Yes       | Efficient, guaranteed O(n log n) performance.                                                |

**Python's `sorted()` Function and `list.sort()` Method:**

Python provides built-in sorting capabilities:

*   `sorted(iterable)`: Returns a *new* sorted list from the elements of any iterable.
*   `list.sort()`: Sorts the list *in-place* (modifies the original list) and returns `None`.

Both use the Timsort algorithm, a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. Timsort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst cases and O(n) in the best case (nearly sorted data).

This covers the problem comprehensively.  Two solution approaches are provided (Hash Map + Sorting, and Hash Map + Min-Heap), with the Min-Heap solution meeting the follow-up time complexity requirement. The README explains both approaches clearly, including time/space complexities and trade-offs.  The topic files (Hash Table, Heap, String, and Sorting) are well-written and cover all relevant concepts.
