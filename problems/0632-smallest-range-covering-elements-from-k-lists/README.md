Okay, let's create the solution, README, and topic files for LeetCode problem 632: "Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists". This problem is efficiently solved using a min-heap.

**Step 1: Problem Identification**

*   **Problem Number:** 632
*   **Problem Name:** Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists
*   **Difficulty:** Hard

**Step 2: Problem File Creation**

I'll create a folder named `0632-smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists`.

**Step 3: Solution File Generation**

The most efficient approach uses a min-heap:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create a min-heap to store elements from each list.  Each element in the heap will be a tuple: `(value, list_index, element_index)`.
    *   Keep track of the current `max_val` in the heap (the largest element currently in the heap).
    *   Initialize `min_range` to a large range (e.g., `[float('-inf'), float('inf')]`).
2.  **Populate Initial Heap:** Add the *first* element from each of the `k` lists to the min-heap, along with its list index and element index within that list. Update `max_val`.
3.  **Iteration:**
    *   While the heap contains `k` elements (meaning we have at least one element from each list):
        *   Pop the smallest element `(min_val, list_index, element_index)` from the heap.
        *   Update `min_range` if the current range (`max_val - min_val`) is smaller than the current `min_range`.
        *   If the popped element is *not* the last element in its list:
            *   Get the next element from that list.
            *   Push the next element onto the heap: `(next_val, list_index, element_index + 1)`.
            *   Update `max_val` if the new element is larger.
4.  **Return:** Return the `min_range`.

# 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists, Difficulty: Hard

## Problem Description

You have `k` lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order. Find the *smallest* range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

We define the range `[a, b]` is smaller than range `[c, d]` if `b - a < d - c` or `a < c` if `b - a == d - c`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation:
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: [1,1]
```

**Constraints:**

-   `nums.length == k`
-   `1 <= k <= 3500`
-   `1 <= nums[i].length <= 50`
-   `-10^5 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^5`
-   `nums[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Approach(es)

### Min-Heap

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    -   Create a min-heap `min_heap`.  Each element in the heap will be a tuple: `(value, list_index, element_index)`.
    -   `max_val`:  Keep track of the *maximum* value currently in the heap. Initialize to negative infinity.
    -   `min_range`:  Initialize to a large range (e.g., `[float('-inf'), float('inf')]`).
2.  **Populate Initial Heap:**
    -   Add the *first* element from *each* of the `k` lists to the `min_heap`.
    -   Update `max_val` to be the maximum of these initial elements.
3.  **Iteration:**
    -   While the `min_heap` contains `k` elements (meaning we have at least one element from each list):
        -   Pop the smallest element `(min_val, list_index, element_index)` from the `min_heap`.
        -   **Update `min_range`:** If the current range (`max_val - min_val`) is smaller than the current `min_range` (or has the same size but a smaller starting value), update `min_range`.
        -   **Add Next Element:**
            -   If the popped element is *not* the last element in its list:
                -   Get the *next* element from that list (`nums[list_index][element_index + 1]`).
                -   Push the next element onto the `min_heap`: `(next_val, list_index, element_index + 1)`.
                -   Update `max_val` if the `next_val` is greater than the current `max_val`.
4.  **Return:** Return the `min_range`.

**Data Structures:**

-   Min-Heap (`min_heap`)

**Time Complexity:**

-   O(N log k), where N is the total number of elements in all lists and k is the number of lists.
    -   We process each element at most once (push and pop from the heap).
    -   Heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time because the heap size is at most k.

**Space Complexity:**

-   O(k) to store the min-heap (it holds at most one element from each of the k lists).

**Trade-offs:**

-   Efficiently maintains the smallest element from each list using the min-heap.
-   The `max_val` variable allows us to quickly calculate the current range.
-   The heap ensures that we always consider the smallest possible range at each step.

## Code

## Notes

- This problem is a generalization of merging k sorted lists.
- The min-heap is the key data structure for efficiently finding the smallest element across all lists.
- Keeping track of the `max_val` is essential for calculating the range size.
- The condition `len(min_heap) == len(nums)` ensures that we have at least one element from each list in the current range.
