# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, along with explanations and analysis of time/space complexity. The goal is to document my learning process, practice problem-solving skills, and build a reference for future study.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

-   **[`problems/`](problems/):** Solutions categorized by problem number and name. Each problem has its own folder with solution files and a detailed `README.md`.
-   **[`topics/`](topics/):** Solutions grouped by data structures and algorithms (e.g., arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming). Each topic has a Markdown file explaining relevant concepts and linking to related problems.
-   **[`difficulties/`](difficulties/):** Solutions organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). This can be useful for focused practice.
