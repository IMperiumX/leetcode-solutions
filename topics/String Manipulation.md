# String Manipulation

## Explanation

String manipulation refers to the various operations that can be performed on strings, which are sequences of characters. These operations include modifying, analyzing, and extracting information from strings. String manipulation is a fundamental aspect of many programming tasks, particularly in areas like text processing, data parsing, and web development.

**Common Operations:**

* **Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings together.
* **Slicing:** Extracting a portion (substring) of a string.
* **Searching:** Finding the occurrence of a specific character or substring within a string.
* **Replacing:** Substituting parts of a string with other characters or substrings.
* **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
* **Joining:** Combining a list of strings into a single string, using a specified separator.
* **Case Conversion:** Changing the case of characters (uppercase, lowercase).
* **Trimming:** Removing leading and trailing whitespace (or other specified characters).
* **Length Calculation:** Determining the number of characters in a string.
* **Formatting:** Creating strings with specific formatting, such as inserting values into placeholders.
* **Character Access:** Access individual characters within string using indexing.
