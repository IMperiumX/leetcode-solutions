# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates â€“ you add new plates to the top and remove plates from the top as well.

## Key Concepts

- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** The most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- **Push:** The operation of adding an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** The operation of removing the top element from the stack.
- **Peek/Top:** The operation of viewing the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull:** Checks if the stack is full (relevant in array-based implementations with a fixed size).

## Operations

- `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: Returns `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.
- `isFull()`: Returns `True` if the stack is full, `False` otherwise (in fixed-size implementations).

## Time Complexity

- `push()`: O(1)
- `pop()`: O(1)
- `peek()`: O(1)
- `isEmpty()`: O(1)
- `isFull()`: O(1)

## Space Complexity

- O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack.

## Applications

- **Function Call Stack:** Managing function calls in programming languages.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implementing undo/redo operations in applications.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluating mathematical expressions (e.g., using postfix notation).
- **Backtracking Algorithms:** Solving problems that involve exploring different paths or choices.
- **Browser History:** Managing the back and forward navigation in web browsers.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traversing graphs and trees.

## Implementations

- **Array-based:** Using an array to store the elements. Can have a fixed size or be dynamically resizable.
- **Linked List-based:** Using a linked list to store the elements. Allows for dynamic resizing.
